Not Romeo, prince, he was Mercutio's friend;
Mass, and well said; a merry whoreson, ha!
This day's black fate on more days doth depend;
Poor living corse, closed in a dead man's tomb!
Holding thine ear close to the hollow ground;
That ever I should live to see thee dead!
And yet no further than a wanton's bird;
Ah, well-a-day! he's dead, he's dead, he's dead!
And hide me with a dead man in his shroud;
O Romeo, Romeo, brave Mercutio's dead!
Is partly to behold my lady's face;
And death, not Romeo, take my maidenhead!
May do much danger. Friar John, go hence;
Fie, how my bones ache! what a jaunt have I had!
For fear of that, I still will stay with thee;
Why, lamb! why, lady! fie, you slug-a-bed!
Like death, when he shuts up the day of life;
Sin from thy lips? O trespass sweetly urged!
Thou wilt fall backward when thou comest to age;
It did, it did; alas the day, it did!
I never should forget it: 'Wilt thou not, Jule?' quoth he;
O child! O child! my soul, and not my child!
And where care lodges, sleep will never lie;
See, how she leans her cheek upon her hand!
Things that, to hear them told, have made me tremble;
Art thou gone so? love, lord, ay, husband, friend!
Speak not, reply not, do not answer me;
A jealous hood, a jealous hood!
Deny thy father and refuse thy name;
I bade her come. What, lamb! what, ladybird!
And keep her at my cell till Romeo come;
O serpent heart, hid with a flowering face!
Nay, gentlemen, prepare not to be gone;
In such a gorgeous palace!
To-morrow night look that thou lie alone;
Is guilty of this lamentable chance!
Content thee, gentle coz, let him alone;
Why, love, I say! madam! sweet-heart! why, bride!
To such a greeting: villain am I none;
Revive, look up, or I will die with thee!
A bump as big as a young cockerel's stone;
Thy tempest-tossed body. How now, wife!
Then love-devouring death do what he dare;
Happily met, my lady and my wife!
Tut, I have lost myself; I am not here;
In lasting labour of his pilgrimage!
Thou art up-roused by some distemperature;
The fee-simple! O simple!
Hark, how they knock! Who's there? Romeo, arise;
Be quiet, or--More light, more light! For shame!
A piteous corse, a bloody piteous corse;
What a pestilent knave is this same!
Proud can I never be of what I hate;
What simpleness is this! I come, I come!
His name is Romeo, and a Montague;
We are undone, lady, we are undone!
He came with flowers to strew his lady's grave;
Romeo, away, be gone!
I beg for justice, which thou, prince, must give;
O, that she knew she were!
Acquaint her here of my son Paris' love;
O any thing, of nothing first create!
Therefore, have done: some grief shows much of love;
My only love sprung from my only hate!
If love be rough with you, be rough with love;
Benedicite!
Men's eyes were made to look, and let them gaze;
Where be these enemies? Capulet! Montague!
Her blood is settled, and her joints are stiff;
I would the fool were married to her grave!
By heaven, I love thee better than myself;
It is my lady, O, it is my love!
Give me a torch: I am not for this ambling;
Should be so tyrannous and rough in proof!
Turn giddy, and be holp by backward turning;
wilt tutor me from quarrelling!
She's not well married that lives married long;
Hang thee, young baggage! disobedient wretch!
The world affords no law to make thee rich;
O love! O life! not life, but love in death!
One pain is lessen'd by another's anguish;
sick health!
I brought my master news of Juliet's death;
hai!
Yea, is the worst well? very well took, i' faith;
That I might touch that cheek!
Seal'd up the doors, and would not let us forth;
The dashing rocks thy sea-sick weary bark!
That is no slander, sir, which is a truth;
And in my temper soften'd valour's steel!
Contempt and beggary hangs upon thy back;
Farewell!
Delay this marriage for a month, a week;
Should, without eyes, see pathways to his will!
And we mean well in going to this mask;
O, I am fortune's fool!
Turn from their office to black funeral;
And then my husband--God be with his soul!
She would be as swift in motion as a ball;
Madam!
Then hie you hence to Friar Laurence' cell;
[Within] Madam!
O friar, the damned use that word in hell;
Upon his body that slaughter'd him!
In man as well as herbs, grace and rude will;
Then, dreadful trumpet, sound the general doom!
And, if we meet, we shall not scape a brawl;
You will set cock-a-hoop! you'll be the man!
Nay, as they dare. I will bite my thumb at them;
O courteous Tybalt! honest gentleman!
And by and by my master drew on him;
Antony, and Potpan!
Proportion'd as one's thought would wish a man;
Amen!
Here is a friar, and slaughter'd Romeo's man;
What, dress'd! and in your clothes! and down again!
It is too rash, too unadvised, too sudden;
Beguiled, divorced, wronged, spited, slain!
And find delight writ there with beauty's pen;
Alive, in triumph! and Mercutio slain!
That murder'd me: I would forget it fain;
O calm, dishonourable, vile submission!
How fares my Juliet? that I ask again;
Anon!
Sovereign, here lies the County Paris slain;
Anon, anon!
Still blush, as thinking their own kisses sin;
To catch my death with jaunting up and down!
The most you sought was her promotion;
By cruel cruel thee quite overthrown!
Till she had laid it and conjured it down;
Romeo!
Romeo slew him, he slew Mercutio;
Who ever would have thought it? Romeo!
And from my soul too;
Shame come to Romeo!
My father Capulet will have it so;
What noise is this? Give me my long sword, ho!
What, goodman boy! I say, he shall: go to;
Holy Franciscan friar! brother, ho!
Athwart men's noses as they lie asleep;
Up to the ears. Come, we burn daylight, ho!
Go waken Juliet, go and trim her up;
Hold, Tybalt! good Mercutio!
That pierced the fearful hollow of thine ear;
Marry, and amen, how sound is she asleep!
To breathe such vows as lovers use to swear;
Beauty too rich for use, for earth too dear!
Live here in heaven and may look on her;
Give me, give me! O, tell not me of fear!
Scaring the ladies like a crow-keeper;
An open et caetera, thou a poperin pear!
From off the battlements of yonder tower;
Yea, noise? then I'll be brief. O happy dagger!
And bring thee cords made like a tackled stair;
shift a trencher? he scrape a trencher!
Death is my son-in-law, Death is my heir;
And thou and Romeo press one heavy bier!
So many thousand times? Go, counsellor;
Peter!
God join'd my heart and Romeo's, thou our hands;
O heavens! O wife, look how our daughter bleeds!
I will be deaf to pleading and excuses;
bones, their bones!
Being purged, a fire sparkling in lovers' eyes;
And soundly too: your houses!
Go hence, to have more talk of these sad things;
Down with the Capulets! down with the Montagues!
Love is a smoke raised with the fume of sighs;
Still-waking sleep, that is not what it is!
Sailing in this salt flood; the winds, thy sighs;
Mercutio's kinsman, noble County Paris!
Which mannerly devotion shows in this;
Mis-shapen chaos of well-seeming forms!
With reeky shanks and yellow chapless skulls;
Transparent heretics, be burnt for liars!
To help me after? I will kiss thy lips;
O deadly sin! O rude unthankfulness!
Where serpents are; chain me with roaring bears;
You'll make a mutiny among my guests!
And since that time it is eleven years;
God forbid! Where's this girl? What, Juliet!
'Signior Martino and his wife and daughters;
Ere one can say 'It lightens.' Sweet, good night!
Be not her maid, since she is envious;
O, she doth teach the torches to burn bright!
The tears have got small victory by that;
And cruel death hath catch'd it from my sight!
Romeo, there dead, was husband to that Juliet;
Come to redeem me? there's a fearful point!
Be plain, good son, and homely in thy drift;
make you dance. 'Zounds, consort!
Alas, my liege, my wife is dead to-night;
Come to thy heart as that within my breast!
To bear a poison, I would temper it;
Where should she be? How oddly thou repliest!
And then dreams he of smelling out a suit;
To see, now, how a jest shall come about!
With Cupid's arrow; she hath Dian's wit;
Dry sorrow drinks our blood. Adieu, adieu!
Came I to take her from her kindred's vault;
And beg your pardon: pardon, I beseech you!
He heareth not, he stirreth not, he moveth not;
And fire-eyed fury be my conduct now!
God Pardon him! I do, with all my heart;
O lamentable day!
For this, being smelt, with that part cheers each part;
Accursed, unhappy, wretched, hateful day!
No warmth, no breath, shall testify thou livest;
O woe! O woful, woful, woful day!
That he dares ne'er come back to challenge you;
Look, look! O heavy day!
The world is not thy friend nor the world's law;
Upon a rapier's point: stay, Tybalt, stay!
Doth grace for grace and love for love allow;
It is, it is: hie hence, be gone, away!
What, not a word? you take your pennyworths now;
I must needs wake you; Lady! lady! lady!
I will, and know her mind early to-morrow;
Yet 'banished'? Hang up philosophy!
Tybalt, here slain, whom Romeo's hand did slay;
Wilt thou provoke me? then have at thee, boy!
Go before, nurse: commend me to thy lady;
What, ho! apothecary!
'Tis but thy name that is my enemy;
Rest you merry!
be-rhyme her; Dido a dowdy; Cleopatra a gipsy;
Poor sacrifices of our enmity!
To mangle me with that word 'banished'?
To prison, eyes, ne'er look on liberty!
Why should you fall into so deep an O?
Hath Romeo slain himself? say thou but 'I,'
Is Romeo slaughter'd, and is Tybalt dead?
That 'banished,' that one word 'banished,'
God gi' god-den. I pray, sir, can you read?
By my troth, it is well said; 'for himself to mar,'
Fie, fie! what, are you mad?
Or those eyes shut, that make thee answer 'I.'
Now, good sweet nurse,--O Lord, why look'st thou sad?
ease:' O, an you will have me live, play 'Heart's ease.'
O, wilt thou leave me so unsatisfied?
Your worship in that sense may call him 'man.'
O God!--O nurse, how shall this be prevented?
One calls within 'Juliet.'
Shall I speak ill of him that is my husband?
Wilt thou not, Jule?' it stinted and said 'Ay.'
What hast thou found?
The pretty wretch left crying and said 'Ay.'
My dear-loved cousin, and my dearer lord?
'lady, lady, lady.'
A crutch, a crutch! why call you for a sword?
Cry but 'Ay me!' pronounce but 'love' and 'dove;'
And pluck the mangled Tybalt from his shroud?
'Proud,' and 'I thank you,' and 'I thank you not;'
He'll fright you up, i' faith. Will it not be?
Where is your mother?'
'Yea,' quoth he, 'dost thou fall upon thy face?
But Montague is bound as well as I,
Sirrah, what made your master in this place?
For still thy eyes, which I may call the sea,
What's he that follows there, that would not dance?
As that vast shore wash'd with the farthest sea,
To Lammas-tide?
Whose sale is present death in Mantua,
Shall I send to thee?
The traces of the smallest spider's web,
Have you deliver'd to her our decree?
How if, when I am laid into the tomb,
What further woe conspires against mine age?
That monthly changes in her circled orb,
Jesu, what haste? can you not stay awhile?
And ere this hand, by thee to Romeo seal'd,
What early tongue so sweet saluteth me?
So Romeo would, were he not Romeo call'd,
assembly: whither should they come?
Of fair demesnes, youthful, and nobly train'd,
God pardon sin! wast thou with Rosaline?
A sin-absolver, and my friend profess'd,
Nurse! What should she do here?
With gentle breath, calm look, knees humbly bow'd,
What noise is here?
Subtly hath minister'd to have me dead,
How long hath he been there?
Put not another sin upon my head,
What's there?
The day is hot, the Capulets abroad,
How camest thou hither, tell me, and wherefore?
And bid her hasten all the house to bed,
was I with you there for the goose?
The shady curtains from Aurora's bed,
Nurse?
Go, get thee to thy love, as was decreed,
What say'st thou, my dear nurse?
And world's exile is death: then banished,
What, shall this speech be spoke for our excuse?
The fiery Tybalt, with his sword prepared,
To cross my obsequies and true love's rite?
No faith, no honesty in men; all perjured,
Then she hath sworn that she will still live chaste?
Nay, I do bear a brain:--but, as I said,
Did ever dragon keep so fair a cave?
The time and my intents are savage-wild,
The ship, sir, the slip; can you not conceive?
To wield old partisans, in hands as old,
Wouldst thou withdraw it? for what purpose, love?
Give me some present counsel, or, behold,
Of love?
Hence-banished is banish'd from the world,
Why, is not this better now than groaning for love?
Who lets it hop a little from her hand,
Who now the price of his dear blood doth owe?
To think it was so? O, give me thy hand,
Above the clouds, as high as heaven itself?
The measure done, I'll watch her place of stand,
Hast thou slain Tybalt? wilt thou slay thyself?
Bliss be upon you! Tell me, good my friend,
Is he gone, and hath nothing?
We sucking on her natural bosom find,
Shall I be married then to-morrow morning?
In truth, fair Montague, I am too fond,
Is the day so young?
To soar with his light feathers, and so bound,
Come, is the bride ready to go to church?
'When griping grief the heart doth wound,
That Romeo bid thee fetch?
Unhappy fortune! by my brotherhood,
In moral paradise of such sweet flesh?
Pale, pale as ashes, all bedaub'd in blood,
Evermore weeping for your cousin's death?
Well, sir; my mistress is the sweetest lady--Lord,
Do you not see that I am out of breath?
What, drawn, and talk of peace! I hate the word,
Why rail'st thou on thy birth, the heaven, and earth?
'Romeo is banished,' to speak that word,
Pretty! What say you, Hugh Rebeck?
I do but keep the peace: put up thy sword,
Why, may one ask?
I do remember well where I should be,
eye but such an eye would spy out such a quarrel?
Read o'er the volume of young Paris' face,
What if this mixture do not work at all?
Have I thought long to see this morning's face,
Who knocks so hard? whence come you? what's your will?
Either withdraw unto some private place,
What villain madam?
If I do so, it will be of more price,
What less than dooms-day is the prince's doom?
And, being anger'd, puffs away from thence,
Speak, nephew, were you by when it began?
An I might live to see thee married once,
What say you? can you love the gentleman?
That westward rooteth from the city's side,
That's my good son: but where hast thou been, then?
For, by my soul, I'll ne'er acknowledge thee,
All this is comfort; wherefore weep I then?
There art thou happy: Tybalt would kill thee,
Will you speak well of him that kill'd your cousin?
Well, do not swear: although I joy in thee,
How! turn thy back and run?
My love as deep; the more I give to thee,
may find the young Romeo?
Nor get a messenger to bring it thee,
Because he married me before to Romeo?
Inherit at my house; hear all, all see,
Here's such a coil! come, what says Romeo?
Hadst thou no poison mix'd, no sharp-ground knife,
O Romeo, Romeo! wherefore art thou Romeo?
To rid her from this second marriage,
Come, shall we go?
And the continuance of their parents' rage,
Romeo! O, pale! Who else? what, Paris too?
Our solemn hymns to sullen dirges change,
How canst thou try them so?
Piteous predicament! Even so lies she,
Why, how now, kinsman! wherefore storm you so?
That fair for which love groan'd for and would die,
What are they, I beseech your ladyship?
My daughter he hath wedded: I will die,
[Within] Ho, daughter! are you up?
And these, who often drown'd could never die,
Hast thou no letters to me from the friar?
And the demesnes that there adjacent lie,
Spakest thou of Juliet? how is it with her?
In the mean time, against thou shalt awake,
What unaccustom'd cause procures her hither?
If that thy bent of love be honourable,
What is her mother?
Seal up the mouth of outrage for a while,
Who is't that calls? is it my lady mother?
Where on a sudden one hath wounded me,
rosemary and Romeo begin both with a letter?
That you shall rest but little. God forgive me,
Do you quarrel, sir?
And she, too desperate, would not go with me,
Do you bite your thumb at us, sir?
But that a joy past joy calls out on me,
Thee here in dark to be his paramour?
To County Paris: then comes she to me,
Ay me! what news? why dost thou wring thy hands?
Prodigious birth of love it is to me,
What curious eye doth quote deformities?
A thing like death to chide away this shame,
Is this the poultice for my aching bones?
Without that title. Romeo, doff thy name,
O thou untaught! what manners is in this?
Therefore, out of thy long-experienced time,
What's this? what's this?
My sword, I say! Old Montague is come,
How now, how now, chop-logic! What is this?
If e'er thou wast thyself and these woes thine,
[Aside] Shall I hear more, or shall I speak at this?
And, in this rage, with some great kinsman's bone,
How! will she none? doth she not give us thanks?
Go in: and tell my lady I am gone,
Have you importuned him by any means?
So please you, let me now be left alone,
What fear is this which startles in our ears?
May stand in number, though in reckoning none,
What, wilt thou wash him from his grave with tears?
Uncle, this is a Montague, our foe,
It was. What sadness lengthens Romeo's hours?
Hold, daughter: I do spy a kind of hope,
Or shall I come to you at evening mass?
As I did sleep under this yew-tree here,
What will you give us?
Thou, wretched boy, that didst consort him here,
Can heaven be so envious?
I shall forget, to have thee still stand there,
What?
Feather of lead, bright smoke, cold fire,
She speaks yet she says nothing: what of that?
And Romeo dead; and Juliet, dead before,
Madam, in happy time, what day is that?
Such as I love; and you, among the store,
Good heart, at what?
To know our further pleasure in this case,
Is she a Capulet?
Do thou but call my resolution wise,
What satisfaction canst thou have to-night?
Sometime she gallops o'er a courtier's nose,
When I, thy three-hours wife, have mangled it?
Ay, those attires are best: but, gentle nurse,
Who is it?
And may not wear them. O, here comes my nurse,
encounter Tybalt?
Her mother is the lady of the house,
That I yet know not?
It shall be Romeo, whom you know I hate,
What, art thou hurt?
See, what a scourge is laid upon your hate,
That calls our person from our morning's rest?
Afore me! it is so very very late,
Good morrow to you both. What counterfeit did I give you?
A villain that is hither come in spite,
She, I'll swear, hath corns; am I come near ye now?
Therefore use none: let Romeo hence in haste,
ay?
How much salt water thrown away in waste,
Have you got leave to go to shrift to-day?
This is that banish'd haughty Montague,
Where are the vile beginners of this fray?
his tongue,
Why dost thou stay?
Not in a grave,
Two may keep counsel, putting one away?
But to the earth some special good doth give,
Or shall we on without a apology?
What, rouse thee, man! thy Juliet is alive,
To sunder his that was thine enemy?
The fearful passage of their death-mark'd love,
What storm is this that blows so contrary?
My words would bandy her to my sweet love,
To murder, murder our solemnity?
To answer 'I'll not wed; I cannot love,
FRIAR LAURENCE

But by and by comes back to Romeo,

The people in the street cry Romeo,

Help me into some house, Benvolio,

I bear no hatred, blessed man, for, lo,

O shut the door! and when thou hast done so,

Tickling a parson's nose as a' lies asleep,

Your plaintain-leaf is excellent for that.

And, to say truth, Verona brags of him

Farewell: thou canst not teach me to forget.
With this night's revels and expire the term
Open the tomb, lay me with Juliet.
Consort! what, dost thou make us minstrels? an

And, with wild looks, bid me devise some mean
Riddling confession finds but riddling shrift.

Second Musician

Third Musician

First Musician
Good night.
First Musician
I thank you, honest gentlemen; good night.
First Musician
For I ne'er saw true beauty till this night.
First Musician
But you shall bear the burden soon at night.
A man, young lady! lady, such a man
That birds would sing and think it were not night.
An I were so apt to quarrel as thou art, any man
Our Romeo hath not been in bed to-night.
Third Watchman
Well, Juliet, I will lie with thee to-night.
First Watchman
It rains downright.
First Watchman
Thy face is mine, and thou hast slander'd it.
First Watchman
They must take it in sense that feel it.
Alone, in company, still my care hath been

Her vestal livery is but sick and green
Let me stand here till thou remember it.
Enter CAPULET, LADY CAPULET, Nurse, and two Servingmen
Romeo will answer it.

A right fair mark, fair coz, is soonest hit.
As daylight doth a lamp; her eyes in heaven
But much of grief shows still some want of wit.

Yet nature's tears are reason's merriment.

With open outcry toward our monument.
Noise within

Nurse calls within
None but for some and yet all different.
Rosaline; Livia; Signior Valentio and his cousin
Come between us, good Benvolio; my wits faint.
Thou desperate pilot, now at once run on
And quench the fire, the room is grown too hot.
That were some spite: my invocation
Therefore farewell; I see thou know'st me not.
Of disobedient opposition
Nay, good goose, bite not.
I saw no man use you a pleasure; if I had, my weapon
Uneven is the course, I like it not.
And here he writes that he did buy a poison
This is dear mercy, and thou seest it not.

And thou art wedded to calamity.
Where, for these many hundred years, the bones
And yet not fall; so light is vanity.
That shows thee a weak slave; for the weakest goes
I think it best you married with the county.
And more inconstant than the wind, who wooes
So loving-jealous of his liberty.
But the true ground of all these piteous woes
Think true love acted simple modesty.
Retires
Farewell, my coz.
Lovers can see to do their amorous rites
Sweet, so would I:
More honourable state, more courtship lives
With all the admired beauties of Verona:
Retain that dear perfection which he owes
As one dead in the bottom of a tomb:
Having some business, do entreat her eyes
The sun, for sorrow, will not show his head:
More than prince of cats, I can tell you. O, he is
So soon to bid good morrow to thy bed:

But Romeo may not; he is banished:

Some shall be pardon'd, and some punished:
Her nurse is privy: and, if aught in this
Both you and I; for Romeo is exiled:
No nightingale: look, love, what envious streaks
Thou wast the prettiest babe that e'er I nursed:
man; but, I'll warrant you, when I say so, she looks
Tush, thou art deceived:
And flecked darkness like a drunkard reels
And bid me stand aloof, and so I did:
They fight; TYBALT falls
Ha! let me see her: out, alas! she's cold:
Enter FRIAR LAURENCE and PARIS, with Musicians
That villain cousin would have kill'd my husband:
She falls upon her bed, within the curtains
Hold thy desperate hand:
Alack, alack, what blood is this, which stains
O brother Montague, give me thy hand:
Musicians waiting. Enter Servingmen with napkins
Poison, I see, hath been his timeless end:
For I have need of many orisons
Of that tongue's utterance, yet I know the sound:
I was your mother much upon these years
And stole into the covert of the wood:
Some consequence yet hanging in the stars
me quivers. Scurvy knave! Pray you, sir, a word:
how art thou fishified! Now is he for the numbers
Tut, dun's the mouse, the constable's own word:
Enter Prince, attended; MONTAGUE, CAPULET, their Wives, and others
I take thee at thy word:
Enter MONTAGUE and others
And like her most whose merit most shall be:
Enter CAPULET, with JULIET and others of his house, meeting the Guests and Maskers
Then dreams, he of another benefice:
TYBALT under ROMEO's arm stabs MERCUTIO, and flies with his followers
After the prompter, for our entrance:
I must up-fill this osier cage of ours
Immediately we do exile him hence:
Being held a foe, he may not have access
I do beseech you, sir, have patience:
And she as much in love, her means much less
For fair without the fair within to hide:
The doors of breath, seal with a righteous kiss
Condemned villain, I do apprehend thee:
And, with a martial scorn, with one hand beats
That almost freezes up the heat of life:
Take our good meaning, for our judgment sits
There stays a husband to make you a wife:
Enter the PRINCE and Attendants
Making them women of good carriage:
Enter MERCUTIO, BENVOLIO, Page, and Servants
Mistress! what, mistress! Juliet! fast, I warrant her, she:
Now, sir, her father counts it dangerous
Within three hours will fair Juliet wake:
And a good lady, and a wise and virtuous
O fortune, fortune! all men call thee fickle:
Enter Chorus
You Capulet; shall go along with me:

And his to me:
These happy masks that kiss fair ladies' brows
For such a wish! he was not born to shame:
Where is she? and how doth she? and what says
And joy comes well in such a needy time:
Shall play the umpire, arbitrating that
That you shall all repent the loss of mine:
A sleeping potion; which so took effect
'Tis almost morning; I would have thee gone:
Since birth, and heaven, and earth, all three do meet
I cannot bound a pitch above dull woe:
He that is strucken blind cannot forget
And but thou love me, let them find me here:
Enter FRIAR LAURENCE, with a basket
Was woe enough, if it had ended there:
Second Capulet
I pray thee, good Mercutio, let's retire:
There shall no figure at such rate be set
But I can give thee more:
Without a sudden calm, will overset
thou what thou art, by art as well as by nature:
I am too sore enpierced with his shaft
Thursday is near; lay hand on heart, advise:
Get me an iron crow, and bring it straight
very first house, of the first and second cause:
They fight
Canker'd with peace, to part your canker'd hate:
They fight
Go hence; good night; and here stands all your state:
Of limping winter treads, even such delight
Affection makes him false; he speaks not true:
It seems she hangs upon the cheek of night
Not proud, you have; but thankful, that you have:
That all the world will be in love with night
thy wits than, I am sure, I have in my whole five:
What man art thou that thus bescreen'd in night
Till thou shalt know the reason of my love:
Among fresh female buds shall you this night
Juliet, on Thursday early will I rouse ye:
Will watch thy waking, and that very night
That you are now a maid. Thus then in brief:
Saint Francis be my speed! how oft to-night
out; what she bade me say, I will keep to myself:
Would through the airy region stream so bright
Give me thy torch, boy: hence, and stand aloof:
worn out thy pump, that when the single sole of it
And yours, close fighting ere I did approach:
He climbs the wall, and leaps down within it
In all her best array bear her to church:
Well, in that hit you miss: she'll not be hit
What, man! 'tis not so much, 'tis not so much:
Lo, here upon thy cheek the stain doth sit
Appear thou in the likeness of a sigh:
Exit
Shall, stiff and stark and cold, appear like death:
Exit
Grief of my son's exile hath stopp'd her breath:
Exit
She is the hopeful lady of my earth:
Exit
The curfew-bell hath rung, 'tis three o'clock:
Exit
Thou canst not speak of that thou dost not feel:
Exit
And stay, good nurse, behind the abbey wall:
Exit
Then she is well, and nothing can be ill:
Exit
Bid a sick man in sadness make his will:
Exit
I know not how to tell thee who I am:
O prince! O cousin! husband! O, the blood is spilt
you have found him than he was when you sought him:
Thou shalt be borne to that same ancient vault
Romeo, come forth; come forth, thou fearful man:
Servant
We talk here in the public haunt of men:
Servant
Give me a case to put my visage in:
Servant
So early walking did I see your son:
Servant
wakened thy dog that hath lain asleep in the sun:
Servant
Well said, my hearts! You are a princox; go:
Enter CAPULET, PARIS, and Servant
If he be slain, say 'I'; or if not, no:
Second Servant
Which heavy sorrow makes them apt unto:
Second Servant
This field-bed is too cold for me to sleep:
Second Servant
Your lady mother is coming to your chamber:
Exit Servant
And that we have a curse in having her:
First Servant
Ascend her chamber, hence and comfort her:
First Servant
To beautify him, only lacks a cover:
Exit First Servant
To merit bliss by making me despair:
Hold, then; go home, be merry, give consent
Come hither, man. I see that thou art poor:
By heaven, I will tear thee joint by joint
The vaulty heaven so high above our heads:
Exeunt
Both by myself and many other friends:
Exeunt
Play'd for a pair of stainless maidenhoods:
Exeunt
Within thy help and holy physic lies:
Exeunt
Sharp misery had worn him to the bones:
Exeunt
Sirrah, fetch drier logs:
Exeunt
Never was seen so black a day as this:
Exeunt
She speaks:
Exeunt
And she steal love's sweet bait from fearful hooks:
Exeunt
Driving back shadows over louring hills:
Exeunt
Farewell; be trusty, and I'll quit thy pains:
Peace, ho, for shame! confusion's cure lives not
Here is a friar, that trembles, sighs and weeps:
Here comes the lady: O, so light a foot
Forbidden bandying in Verona streets:
O, speak again, bright angel! for thou art
It strains me past the compass of my wits:
A torch for me: let wantons light of heart
I would thou hadst my bones, and I thy news:
Your looks are pale and wild, and do import
For in a minute there are many days:
Of this sir-reverence love, wherein thou stick'st
This trick may chance to scathe you, I know what:
Well said: follow me this jest now till thou hast
On the fair daughter of rich Capulet:
My fingers itch. Wife, we scarce thought us blest
Earth-treading stars that make dark heaven light:
Good night, good night! as sweet repose and rest
Good night:
O, look! methinks I see my cousin's ghost
To be consorted with the humorous night:
Death lies on her like an untimely frost
'Tis very late, she'll not come down to-night:
thou make minstrels of us, look to hear nothing but
That one short minute gives me in her sight:
Going to find a bare-foot brother out
Unless thou tell me how I may prevent it:
Shuts up his windows, locks far daylight out
Which should bedeck thy shape, thy love, thy wit:
Now, afore God, I am so vexed, that every part about
Here in my house do him disparagement:
or a hair less, in his beard, than thou hast: thou
Will ne'er wear out the everlasting flint:
Madam, the guests are come, supper served up, you
Art thou a man? thy form cries out thou art:
and as I told you, my young lady bade me inquire you
Do lace the severing clouds in yonder east:
lives; that I mean to make bold withal, and as you
God save the mark!--here on his manly breast:
Such mortal drugs I have; but Mantua's law
The precious treasure of his eyesight lost:
Most miserable hour that e'er time saw
But, as you will not wed, I'll pardon you:
Enter ROMEO and JULIET above, at the window
And presently took post to tell it you:
No, not a whit: what! I have watch'd ere now
As are behoveful for our state to-morrow:
A rhyme I learn'd even now
Wilt thou be gone? it is not yet near day:
Uncomfortable time, why camest thou now
Of all the days of the year, upon that day:
And yet, I warrant, it had upon its brow
Make haste; the bridegroom he is come already:
At what o'clock to-morrow
Flies may do this, but I from this must fly:
O, musicians, because my heart itself plays 'My
A parlous knock; and it cried bitterly:
Welcome, gentlemen! I have seen the day
Is my dear son with such sour company:
I married them; and their stol'n marriage-day
And turns it to exile; there art thou happy:
And all my fortunes at thy foot I'll lay
May be put from her by society:
I mean, sir, in delay
Hath had no power yet upon thy beauty:

For then thou canst not pass to Mantua;
O, I cry you mercy; you are the singer: I will say
But then a noise did scare me from the tomb;
none of his skains-mates. And thou must stand by
But old folks, many feign as they were dead;
County Anselme and his beauteous sisters; the lady
Dead art thou! Alack! my child is dead;
Seeking out Romeo, that did spit his body
A troubled mind drave me to walk abroad;
Which as they kiss consume: the sweetest honey
Ay, let the county take you in your bed;
but, I'll warrant him, as gentle as a lamb. Go thy
Romeo, good night: I'll to my truckle-bed;
In what vile part of this anatomy
O, this same thought did but forerun my need;
With twenty hundred thousand times more joy
It is supposed, the fair creature died;
Now I have stain'd the childhood of our joy
Virtue itself turns vice, being misapplied;
Which to the high top-gallant of my joy
Call me but love, and I'll be new baptized;
Apothecary
Well, well, thou hast a careful father, child;
Apothecary
For I will raise her statue in pure gold;
Dry up your tears, and stick your rosemary
my errand;
I will omit no opportunity
Lord, how my head aches! what a head have I!
An you be mine, I'll give you to my friend;
Dove-feather'd raven! wolvish-ravening lamb!
Thou counterfeit'st a bark, a sea, a wind;
Despised, distressed, hated, martyr'd, kill'd!
Were of an age: well, Susan is with God;
Alack the day! he's gone, he's kill'd, he's dead!
Bondage is hoarse, and may not speak aloud;
Alack the day, she's dead, she's dead, she's dead!
In one respect I'll thy assistant be;
Alas, alas! Help, help! my lady's dead!
My master knows not but I am gone hence;
O Tybalt, Tybalt, the best friend I had!
See, where he comes: so please you, step aside;
inch narrow to an ell broad!
Because it is an enemy to thee;
Rather than Paris. These are news indeed!
A pair of star-cross'd lovers take their life;
When King Cophetua loved the beggar-maid!
Is now the two hours' traffic of our stage;
Tybalt, my cousin! O my brother's child!
We see the ground whereon these woes do lie;
That ever, ever, I did yet behold!
As rich shall Romeo's by his lady's lie;
Ancient damnation! O most wicked fiend!
Up, sir, go with me;
And, in despite, I'll cram thee with more food!
And this shall free thee from this present shame;
Have at thee, coward!
Ay, you have been a mouse-hunt in your time;
Peace, peace, Mercutio, peace!
As mine on hers, so hers is set on mine;
You tallow-face!
Fly hence, and leave me: think upon these gone;
Peace, I have done. God mark thee to his grace!
I'll not to bed to-night; let me alone;
O, break, my heart! poor bankrupt, break at once!
Now must I to the monument alone;
Come, bitter conduct, come, unsavoury guide!
My bosom's lord sits lightly in his throne;
No, marry; I fear thee!
That is renown'd for faith? Be fickle, fortune;
Call this a lightning? O my love! my wife!
Vile earth, to earth resign; end motion here;
Out, you green-sickness carrion! out, you baggage!
By love, who first did prompt me to inquire;
Gentlemen, for shame, forbear this outrage!
For I am proverb'd with a grandsire phrase;
Ay me!
He is wise;
Belonging to a man. O, be some other name!
The clock struck nine when I did send the nurse;
O woful time!
Where and what time thou wilt perform the rite;
Hath wash'd thy sallow cheeks for Rosaline!
He is a kinsman to the Montague;
By urging me to fury: O, be gone!
I'll bury thee in a triumphant grave;
Holy Saint Francis, what a change is here!
An if thou couldst, thou couldst not make him live;
Nurse!
And therefore have I little talk'd of love;
Why, then, O brawling love! O loving hate!
Through lovers' brains, and then they dream of love;
Too early seen unknown, and known too late!
And, to sink in it, should you burden love;
To season love, that of it doth not taste!
Ah, Juliet, I already know thy grief;
Stop thy unhallow'd toil, vile Montague!
And this distilled liquor drink thou off;
Here's to my love!
My blood for your rude brawls doth lie a-bleeding;
Upon so soft a subject as myself!
Stay not to question, for the watch is coming;
Out on her, hilding!
Back, foolish tears, back to your native spring;
To see it tetchy and fall out with the dug!
Soft! I will go along;
A dateless bargain to engrossing death!
Killing that love which thou hast vow'd to cherish;
Would none but I might venge my cousin's death!
Let me be ta'en, let me be put to death;
Or ill-beseeming beast in seeming both!
This is thy sheath;
My back o' t' other side,--O, my back, my back!
Of honourable reckoning are you both;
One writ with me in sour misfortune's book!
They are but beggars that can count their worth;
Beautiful tyrant! fiend angelical!
A pack of blessings lights up upon thy back;
A sail, a sail!
No money, on my faith, but the gleek;
Ah, word ill urged to one that is so ill!
Come, come with me, and we will make short work;
Peace, you mumbling fool!
I nursed her daughter, that you talk'd withal;
O God, I have an ill-divining soul!
Do not swear at all;
You'll not endure him! God shall mend my soul!
Sitting in the sun under the dove-house wall;
[Within] Madam!
I met the youthful lord at Laurence' cell;
I must needs wake her. Madam, madam, madam!
The heavens do lour upon you for some ill;
O, what a beast was I to chide at him!
But let them measure us by what they will;
And it mis-sheathed in my daughter's bosom!
Utter your gravity o'er a gossip's bowl;
Unseemly woman in a seeming man!
Sir, go you in; and, madam, go with him;
O, he's a lovely gentleman!
Digressing from the valour of a man;
To enter in the thoughts of desperate men!
Good gentle youth, tempt not a desperate man;
To lure this tassel-gentle back again!
He bears him like a portly gentleman;
A damned saint, an honourable villain!
On Lammas-eve at night shall she be fourteen;
O, I am slain!
My husband is on earth, my faith in heaven;
O cousin, cousin!
We must talk in secret:--nurse, come back again;
God shield I should disturb devotion!
My husband lives, that Tybalt would have slain;
Anon!
Where is my mother! why, she is within;
O, well-a-day, that ever I was born!
Some say the lark makes sweet division;
Clubs, bills, and partisans! strike! beat them down!
Some means to come to shrift this afternoon;
Romeo!
O, then, dear saint, let lips do what hands do;
Though heaven cannot: O Romeo, Romeo!
With Rosaline, my ghostly father? no;
Romeo! my cousin Romeo!
Therefore love moderately; long love doth so;
Ere I again behold my Romeo!
Go to, go to;
Farewell, my lord. Light to my chamber, ho!
We'll keep no great ado,--a friend or two;
I'll play the housewife for this once. What, ho!
Thou wilt be taken. Stay awhile! Stand up;
A bawd, a bawd, a bawd! so ho!
Honest goodfellows, ah, put up, put up;
O, now I would they had changed voices too!
Like a rich jewel in an Ethiope's ear;
Come weep with me; past hope, past cure, past help!
Doth make against me of this direful murder;
O God's lady dear!
Go thou to Juliet, help to deck up her;
Here's goodly gear!
Marry, go before to field, he'll be your follower;
News from Verona!--How now, Balthasar!
Being black put us in mind they hide the fair;
God in heaven bless her!
And young affection gapes to be his heir;
Farewell, dear father!
'Tis more, 'tis more, his son is elder, sir;
Peter!
Ay, the heads of the maids, or their maidenheads;
Romeo! humours! madman! passion! lover!
Maintains such falsehood, then turn tears to fires;
O God, she comes!
This wind, you talk of, blows us from ourselves;
More light and light; more dark and dark our woes!
By giving liberty unto thine eyes;
Or I shall faint. A plague o' both your houses!
A glooming peace this morning with it brings;
To hear good counsel: O, what learning is!
Adding to clouds more clouds with his deep sighs;
How well my comfort is revived by this!
Not mad, but bound more than a mad-man is;
Part, fools!
With love's light wings did I o'er-perch these walls;
Like softest music to attending ears!
O, she says nothing, sir, but weeps and weeps;
Is it even so? then I defy you, stars!
Thy old groans ring yet in my ancient ears;
I'll make you quiet. What, cheerly, my hearts!
To stop the inundation of her tears;
That in thy likeness thou appear to us!
'Tis since the earthquake now eleven years;
Why, how now, Juliet!
Hath had no notice of these accidents;
A thousand times good night!
Is thy news good, or bad? answer to that;
Did my heart love till now? forswear it, sight!
By any other name would smell as sweet;
What I have spoke: but farewell compliment!
Nay, sit, nay, sit, good cousin Capulet;
That after hours with sorrow chide us not!
Come, night; come, Romeo; come, thou day in night;
Sleep dwell upon thine eyes, peace in thy breast!
I have night's cloak to hide me from their sight;
From this world-wearied flesh. Eyes, look your last!
Upon his brow shame is ashamed to sit;
Would I were sleep and peace, so sweet to rest!
Thou wilt fall backward when thou hast more wit;
I hear some noise within; dear love, adieu!
Fie, fie, thou shamest thy shape, thy love, thy wit;
Out upon you! what a man are you!
true descent;
Despised substance of divinest show!
And what love can do that dares love attempt;
She's dead, deceased, she's dead; alack the day!
My will to her consent is but a part;
O lamentable day!
This night you shall behold him at our feast;
O day! O day! O day! O hateful day!
She could have run and waddled all about;
O woful day, O woful day!
And let the nurse this night sit up with you;
Nurse! Wife! What, ho! What, nurse, I say!
When the sun sets, the air doth drizzle dew;
If thou art taken: hence, be gone, away!
Are you at leisure, holy father, now;
O, sweet my mother, cast me not away!
'Tis but the pale reflex of Cynthia's brow;
Some aqua vitae, ho! My lord! my lady!
Are you so hot? marry, come up, I trow;
Just in her case! O woful sympathy!
Happiness courts thee in her best array;
When but love's shadows are so rich in joy!
Though news be sad, yet tell them merrily;
O true apothecary!
That in gold clasps locks in the golden story;
Ye say honestly: rest you merry!
This is as't should be. Let me see the county;
O heavy lightness! serious vanity!
But 'banished' to kill me?--'banished'?
All slain, all dead. 'Romeo is banished!'
Let me be satisfied, is't good or bad?
Why follow'd not, when she said 'Tybalt's dead,'
What if her eyes were there, they in her head?
for you. It is 'music with her silver sound,'
Why, Romeo, art thou mad?
Dost thou love me? I know thou wilt say 'Ay,'
What should it be, that they so shriek abroad?
I am too young; I pray you, pardon me.'
You are a saucy boy: is't so, indeed?
Here lives a caitiff wretch would sell it him.'
How stands your disposition to be married?
With speedy help doth lend redress.'
Which modern lamentations might have moved?
Much more than death: do not say 'banishment.'
What's here? a cup, closed in my true love's hand?
And, pretty fool, it stinted and said 'Ay.'
O God! did Romeo's hand shed Tybalt's blood?
To think it should leave crying and say 'Ay.'
O comfortable friar! where is my lord?
'Tybalt is dead, and Romeo--banished;'
Who calls so loud?
Ha, banishment! be merciful, say 'death;'
Where the devil should this Romeo be?
Why 'Heart's ease?'
To lie discolour'd by this place of peace?
am peppered, I warrant, for this world. A plague o'
'Yea,' quoth my husband,'fall'st upon thy face?
Alack, alack, is it not like that I,
By whose direction found'st thou out this place?
My bounty is as boundless as the sea,
What, is my daughter gone to Friar Laurence?
Then weep no more. I'll send to one in Mantua,
What, shall I groan and tell thee?
But I will write again to Mantua,
For what, I pray thee?
The orchard walls are high and hard to climb,
pray, can you read any thing you see?
What is her burying grave that is her womb,
Tybalt, that murderer, which way ran he?
Made by the joiner squirrel or old grub,
I'll fa you; do you note me?
Most detestable death, by thee beguil'd,
What wouldst thou have with me?
And, in strong proof of chastity well arm'd,
ways, wench; serve God. What, have you dined at home?
Lest in this marriage he should be dishonour'd,
For who is living, if those two are gone?
Ah me! how sweet is love itself possess'd,
Where shall we dine? O me! What fray was here?
Come, stir, stir, stir! the second cock hath crow'd,
Can I go forward when my heart is here?
And Juliet bleeding, warm, and newly dead,
Have my old feet stumbled at graves! Who's there?
So shall no foot upon the churchyard tread,
The stony entrance of this sepulchre?
Take thou this vial, being then in bed,
too, and suffer every knave to use me at his pleasure?
Go you to Juliet ere you go to bed,
And is it not well served in to a sweet goose?
Shall be the label to another deed,
Where is my father, and my mother, nurse?
Doting like me and like me banished,
My noble uncle, do you know the cause?
Take up those cords: poor ropes, you are beguiled,
Whose house?
An hour but married, Tybalt murdered,
Will you be ready? do you like this haste?
She was too good for me: but, as I said,
Art thou not Romeo and a Montague?
But one, poor one, one poor and loving child,
To press before thy father to a grave?
Now, by my maidenhead, at twelve year old,
Speak briefly, can you like of Paris' love?
With thy black mantle; till strange love, grown bold,
My conceal'd lady to our cancell'd love?
But not possess'd it, and, though I am sold,
In love?
Doing more murders in this loathsome world,
Sweet, sweet, sweet nurse, tell me, what says my love?
O, that I were a glove upon that hand,
That sees into the bottom of my grief?
What sorrow craves acquaintance at my hand,
By doing damned hate upon thyself?
His fault concludes but what the law should end,
How now, my headstrong! where have you been gadding?
The which if you with patient ears attend,
sound'? What say you, Simon Catling?
By their own beauties; or, if love be blind,
Could you not take some occasion without giving?
There is no end, no limit, measure, bound,
Who set this ancient quarrel new abroach?
Throw your mistemper'd weapons to the ground,
Where is the county's page, that raised the watch?
Shut up in prison, kept without my food,
Dost thou not laugh?
Had she affections and warm youthful blood,
Can vengeance be pursued further than death?
For then she could stand alone; nay, by the rood,
And say'st thou yet that exile is not death?
Monday, my lord,
To say to me that thou art out of breath?
Speak to my gossip Venus one fair word,
May not one speak?
Three civil brawls, bred of an airy word,
Tybalt, you rat-catcher, will you walk?
Retorts it: Romeo he cries aloud,
Were in a mask?
Rebellious subjects, enemies to peace,
So stumblest on my counsel?
Come hither, cover'd with an antic face,
How doth my lady? Is my father well?
Thou know'st the mask of night is on my face,
What is your will?
Hist! Romeo, hist! O, for a falconer's voice,
Father, what news? what is the prince's doom?
Is set afire by thine own ignorance,
So worthy a gentleman to be her bridegroom?
Thy fault our law calls death; but the kind prince,
Come hither, nurse. What is yond gentleman?
Let two more summers wither in their pride,
Is it good den?
I do protest, I never injured thee,
You will not, then?
Give me the light: upon thy life, I charge thee,
O think'st thou we shall ever meet again?
And stay thy lady too that lives in thee,
But, wherefore, villain, didst thou kill my cousin?
By one that I'll procure to come to thee,
With blood removed but little from her own?
O, what more favour can I do to thee,
Who bare my letter, then, to Romeo?
Now will he sit under a medlar tree,
Where is my lady's lord, where's Romeo?
O me, O me! My child, my only life,
Welcome from Mantua: what says Romeo?
Some twenty of them fought in this black strife,
And there I am. Where is my Romeo?
And in his wisdom hastes our marriage,
Which way ran he that kill'd Mercutio?
A gentleman of noble parentage,
Have not saints lips, and holy palmers too?
Who had but newly entertain'd revenge,
Said he not so? or did I dream it so?
The earth hath swallow'd all my hopes but she,
And what to?
Give me my Romeo; and, when he shall die,
What, are you busy, ho? need you my help?
Be not so long to speak; I long to die,
My dear?
Now old desire doth in his death-bed lie,
Dost thou not bring me letters from the friar?
No hare, sir; unless a hare, sir, in a lenten pie,
Come you to make confession to this father?
Or, if I live, is it not very like,
Whither?
As in a vault, an ancient receptacle,
warrant, a virtuous,--Where is your mother?
This is the matter:--Nurse, give leave awhile,
What is the matter?
One of our order, to associate me,
Where I may read who pass'd that passing fair?
But come, young waverer, come, go with me,
Do you bite your thumb at us, sir?
Murder'd her kinsman. O, tell me, friar, tell me,
What's he that now is going out of door?
My true love's passion: therefore pardon me,
The heads of the maids?
But thou shalt hear it: whistle then to me,
What, art thou drawn among these heartless hinds?
Wilt thou not, Jule?' and, by my holidame,
And there die strangled ere my Romeo comes?
As if that name,
How should they, when that wise men have no eyes?
Ah, poor my lord, what tongue shall smooth thy name,
Where's Romeo's man? what can he say in this?
Be sacrificed, some hour before his time,
And doth it give me such a sight as this?
In fair Verona, where we lay our scene,
But, soft! what day is this?
And make her airy tongue more hoarse than mine,
But, soft! what light through yonder window breaks?
No matter: get thee gone,
How now! who calls?
Which, too much minded by herself alone,
As with a club, dash out my desperate brains?
That most are busied when they're most alone,
Environed with all these hideous fears?
It is the lark that sings so out of tune,
How now! a conduit, girl? what, still in tears?
Your tributary drops belong to woe,
Well, what was yours?
But that thou overheard'st, ere I was ware,
And madly play with my forefather's joints?
By holy Laurence to fall prostrate here,
What devil art thou, that dost torment me thus?
'Tis torture, and not mercy: heaven is here,
O honey nurse, what news?
Your first is dead; or 'twere as good he were,
Will you tell me that?
Is too much for a score,
What says he of our marriage? what of that?
thou wilt quarrel with a man that hath a hair more,
The what?
O, he is even in my mistress' case,
Tybalt, liest thou there in thy bloody sheet?
But love thee better than thou canst devise,
Came he not home to-night?
But to himself so secret and so close,
Of yonder knight?
Our bridal flowers serve for a buried corse,
Young Romeo is it?
An honour! were not I thine only nurse,
But now, my lord, what say you to my suit?
But He, that hath the steerage of my course,
Why, what is Tybalt?
Or shut me nightly in a charnel-house,
Speakest thou from thy heart?
My life were better ended by their hate,
Was that my father that went hence so fast?
For, hark you, Tybalt being slain so late,
Pretty too! What say you, James Soundpost?
To move the heavens to smile upon my state,
Am I like such a fellow?
I'll go and chat with Paris: hie, make haste,
As you think fit to furnish me to-morrow?
She hath, and in that sparing makes huge waste,
O, where is Romeo? saw you him to-day?
By thee, old Capulet, and Montague,
And there an end. But what say you to Thursday?
And why, my lady wisdom? hold your tongue,
Benvolio, who began this bloody fray?
O my dear kinsman! Prince, as thou art true,
[Within] Lead, boy: which way?
To help to take her from her borrow'd grave,
What shall I swear by?
Where that same banish'd runagate doth live,
Is she not down so late, or up so early?
O, I have bought the mansion of a love,
What say'st thou? hast thou not a word of joy?
Thy wit, that ornament to shape and love,
merchant was this, that was so full of his ropery?
And not impute this yielding to light love,
To fleer and scorn at our solemnity?
Therefore do nimble-pinion'd doves draw love,
FRIAR LAURENCE
Or, if thou wilt not, be but sworn my love,
FRIAR LAURENCE
Black and portentous must this humour prove,
FRIAR LAURENCE
Thou cutt'st my head off with a golden axe,
FRIAR LAURENCE
Now, ere the sun advance his burning eye,
FRIAR LAURENCE
Care keeps his watch in every old man's eye,
FRIAR LAURENCE
That murder'd my love's cousin, with which grief,
FRIAR LAURENCE
Or, if thou wilt, swear by thy gracious self,
FRIAR LAURENCE
Here comes your father; tell him so yourself,
FRIAR LAURENCE
My name, dear saint, is hateful to myself,
FRIAR LAURENCE
Whate'er thou hear'st or seest, stand all aloof,
FRIAR LAURENCE
I have an interest in your hate's proceeding,
FRIAR LAURENCE
And little mouse, every unworthy thing,
FRIAR LAURENCE
At the prefixed hour of her waking,
FRIAR LAURENCE
For then, I hope, thou wilt not keep him long,
FRIAR LAURENCE
And in his needy shop a tortoise hung,
FRIAR LAURENCE
But, like a misbehaved and sullen wench,
FRIAR LAURENCE
The County Paris, at Saint Peter's Church,
FRIAR LAURENCE
And learn me how to lose a winning match,
FRIAR LAURENCE
But now I see this one is one too much,
FRIAR LAURENCE
Yes, madam: yet I cannot choose but laugh,
FRIAR LAURENCE
Without his roe, like a dried herring: flesh, flesh,
FRIAR LAURENCE
Thou detestable maw, thou womb of death,
FRIAR LAURENCE
And fearfully did menace me with death,
FRIAR LAURENCE
But with a rear-ward following Tybalt's death,
FRIAR LAURENCE
Immoderately she weeps for Tybalt's death,
FRIAR LAURENCE
This bud of love, by summer's ripening breath,
FRIAR LAURENCE
Bearing a Tartar's painted bow of lath,
Exeunt CAPULET, LADY CAPULET, PARIS, and FRIAR LAURENCE
Thy father, or thy mother, nay, or both,
Enter FRIAR LAURENCE
Gorged with the dearest morsel of the earth,
Exit FRIAR LAURENCE
Where bloody Tybalt, yet but green in earth,
PRINCE
She wakes; and I entreated her come forth,
PRINCE
Let them affright thee. I beseech thee, youth,
PRINCE
Thou sober-suited matron, all in black,
PRINCE
Here in this city visiting the sick,
PRINCE
In penalty alike; and 'tis not hard, I think,
PRINCE
It was the nightingale, and not the lark,
PRINCE
for this drivelling love is like a great natural,
PRINCE
Death, that hath ta'en her hence to make me wail,

For, I am sure, you have your hands full all,

To paly ashes, thy eyes' windows fall,
MONTAGUE
Having displeased my father, to Laurence' cell,
MONTAGUE
Meaning to keep her closely at my cell,
MONTAGUE
I come, anon.--But if thou mean'st not well,
MONTAGUE
O, in this love, you love your child so ill,
MONTAGUE
Run to my study. By and by! God's will,
LADY MONTAGUE
Put this in any liquid thing you will,
Enter MONTAGUE and LADY MONTAGUE
Of my dug and felt it bitter, pretty fool,
PROLOGUE
Romeo's a dishclout to him: an eagle, madam,
courteous, and a kind, and a handsome, and, I
Being in night, all this is but a dream,
me to-morrow, and you shall find me a grave man. I
Shall give him such an unaccustom'd dram,
arithmetic! Why the devil came you between us? I
Who, raging with thy tears, and they with them,
And hither shall he come: and he and I
We took this mattock and this spade from him,
A visor for a visor! what care I

No, sir, I do not bite my thumb at you, sir, but I

No sudden mean of death, though ne'er so mean,

The gallant, young and noble gentleman,

On the fore-finger of an alderman,

And art thou changed? pronounce this sentence then,
FRIAR JOHN
Two of the fairest stars in all the heaven,
FRIAR JOHN
But he which bore my letter, Friar John,
SAMPSON
Come, knock and enter; and no sooner in,
SAMPSON
Now, Tybalt, take the villain back again,
SAMPSON
Now Romeo is beloved and loves again,
SAMPSON
But to his foe supposed he must complain,
SAMPSON
Which are the children of an idle brain,
SAMPSON
Arise, fair sun, and kill the envious moon,
SAMPSON
And, Montague, come you this afternoon,
SAMPSON
Away from the light steals home my heavy son,
SAMPSON
To grubs and eyeless skulls? as I discern,
SAMPSON
Marry, my child, early next Thursday morn,
ROMEO
Shot from the deadly level of a gun,
ROMEO
I, measuring his affections by my own,
ROMEO
That while Verona by that name is known,
ROMEO
In what I further shall intend to do,
ROMEO
There lies the man, slain by young Romeo,
ROMEO
The form of death: meantime I writ to Romeo,
ROMEO
Go, you cot-quean, go,
ROMEO
'Tis since the nuptials of Lucentio,
ROMEO
Now, by Saint Peter's Church and Peter too,
ROMEO
If I may trust the flattering truth of sleep,
ROMEO
By her high forehead and her scarlet lip,
ROMEO
heart is full of woe:' O, play me some merry dump,
ROMEO
And now falls on her bed; and then starts up,
ROMEO
Come, Montague; for thou art early up,
ROMEO
That presses them and learns them first to bear,
ROMEO
Is Rosaline, whom thou didst love so dear,
ROMEO
I will not marry yet; and, when I do, I swear,
ROMEO
O holy friar, O, tell me, holy friar,
ROMEO
An old hare hoar,
ROMEO
A whining mammet, in her fortune's tender,
ROMEO
And in their triumph die, like fire and powder,
ROMEO
You, to remove that siege of grief from her,
ROMEO
Thou know'st my lodging: get me ink and paper,
ROMEO
Doth she not think me an old murderer,
ROMEO
This precious book of love, this unbound lover,
ROMEO
That idles in the wanton summer air,
ROMEO
She is too fair, too wise, wisely too fair,
ROMEO
One nick-name for her purblind son and heir,
ROMEO
But he, his own affections' counsellor,
ROMEO
Being a divine, a ghostly confessor,
ROMEO
Is but a little way above our heads,
ROMEO
Gallop apace, you fiery-footed steeds,
ROMEO
To blaze your marriage, reconcile your friends,
ROMEO
Conceit, more rich in matter than in words,
ROMEO
Do thou but close our hands with holy words,
ROMEO
Is there no pity sitting in the clouds,
ROMEO
And reason coldly of your grievances,
ROMEO
O'er lawyers' fingers, who straight dream on fees,
ROMEO
Come, he hath hid himself among these trees,
ROMEO
Else would I tear the cave where Echo lies,
ROMEO
Till we can clear these ambiguities,
ROMEO
It is some meteor that the sun exhales,
ROMEO
And then will I be general of your woes,
ROMEO
Which oft the angry Mab with blisters plagues,
ROMEO
Like a poor prisoner in his twisted gyves,
ROMEO
Some say the lark and loathed toad change eyes,
ROMEO
Nor bide the encounter of assailing eyes,
ROMEO
And needly will be rank'd with other griefs,
ROMEO
You are a lover; borrow Cupid's wings,
ROMEO
On this fair corse; and, as the custom is,
ROMEO
Then, as the manner of our country is,
ROMEO
Tell me not, friar, that thou hear'st of this,
ROMEO
If, rather than to marry County Paris,
ROMEO
Now comes the wanton blood up in your cheeks,
ROMEO
And fear'st to die? famine is in thy cheeks,
ROMEO
their books,
ROMEO
Culling of simples; meagre were his looks,
ROMEO
True; and therefore women, being the weaker vessels,
ROMEO
Our instruments to melancholy bells,
ROMEO
There is thy gold, worse poison to men's souls,
ROMEO
The collars of the moonshine's watery beams,
ROMEO
She will not stay the siege of loving terms,
ROMEO
With purple fountains issuing from your veins,
ROMEO
I do defy thy conjurations,
ROMEO
And steal immortal blessing from her lips,
ROMEO
And breathed such life with kisses in my lips,
ROMEO
The sun not yet thy sighs from heaven clears,
ROMEO
She hath not seen the change of fourteen years,
ROMEO
The brightness of her cheek would shame those stars,
ROMEO
And bakes the elflocks in foul sluttish hairs,
ROMEO
I should have been more strange, I must confess,
ROMEO
One who, to put thee from thy heaviness,
ROMEO
So shall you share all that he doth possess,
ROMEO
And then dreams he of cutting foreign throats,
ROMEO
Have thrice disturb'd the quiet of our streets,
ROMEO
Cast by their grave beseeming ornaments,
ROMEO
Stuff'd, as they say, with honourable parts,
ROMEO
Will they not hear? What, ho! you men, you beasts,
ROMEO
O, pardon me for bringing these ill news,
ROMEO
In tatter'd weeds, with overwhelming brows,
ROMEO
Her wagoner a small grey-coated gnat,
ROMEO
So smile the heavens upon this holy act,
Enter BENVOLIO and ROMEO
What is it else? a madness most discreet,
Enter ROMEO
And I'll still stay, to have thee still forget,
Enter ROMEO
Unless philosophy can make a Juliet,
Enter ROMEO
Or am I mad, hearing him talk of Juliet,
Enter ROMEO
I came to talk of. Tell me, daughter Juliet,
BENVOLIO
Tybalt, the kinsman of old Capulet,
BENVOLIO
But look thou stay not till the watch be set,
BENVOLIO
Shall Romeo by my letters know our drift,
BENVOLIO
O'er courtiers' knees, that dream on court'sies straight,
BENVOLIO
Against to-morrow: my heart is wondrous light,
BENVOLIO
And gave him what becomed love I might,
BENVOLIO
The horrible conceit of death and night,
BENVOLIO
That he should hither come as this dire night,
BENVOLIO
The grey-eyed morn smiles on the frowning night,
BENVOLIO
How silver-sweet sound lovers' tongues by night,
BENVOLIO
What cursed foot wanders this way to-night,
BENVOLIO
Or if not so, then here I hit it right,
BENVOLIO
I dreamt my master and another fought,
BENVOLIO
They have made worms' meat of me: I have it,
BENVOLIO
And threatened me with death, going in the vault,
BENVOLIO
And where the worser is predominant,
BENVOLIO
Many for many virtues excellent,
BENVOLIO
For though fond nature bids us an lament,
BENVOLIO
Each part, deprived of supple government,
BENVOLIO
Wash they his wounds with tears: mine shall be spent,
BENVOLIO
Are made already mothers: by my count,
BENVOLIO
I fear it is: and yet, methinks, it should not,
BENVOLIO
And the place death, considering who thou art,
BENVOLIO
Howlings attend it: how hast thou the heart,
BENVOLIO
As Paris hath. Beshrew my very heart,
BENVOLIO
Just opposite to what thou justly seem'st,
BENVOLIO
Peer'd forth the golden window of the east,
BENVOLIO
Our wedding cheer to a sad burial feast,
BENVOLIO
I am the greatest, able to do least,
BENVOLIO
Griefs of mine own lie heavy in my breast,
BENVOLIO
Will I set up my everlasting rest,
BENVOLIO
Whereto I have invited many a guest,
Exeunt all but MONTAGUE, LADY MONTAGUE, and BENVOLIO
As Phaethon would whip you to the west,
Exeunt MERCUTIO and BENVOLIO
For stony limits cannot hold love out,
Re-enter BENVOLIO
Tush, I will stir about,
MERCUTIO
And yet 'not proud,' mistress minion, you,
MERCUTIO
Well, think of marriage now; younger than you,
MERCUTIO
Taking thy part, hath rush'd aside the law,
MERCUTIO
Alas, that love, so gentle in his view,
MERCUTIO
Methinks I see thee, now thou art below,
MERCUTIO
'An if a man did need a poison now,
MERCUTIO
Thy purpose marriage, send me word to-morrow,
MERCUTIO
Shake quoth the dove-house: 'twas no need, I trow,
MERCUTIO
Thy noble shape is but a form of wax,
MERCUTIO
Most lamentable day, most woful day,
MERCUTIO
Day, night, hour, tide, time, work, play,
MERCUTIO
Since arm from arm that voice doth us affray,
MERCUTIO
Whose names are written there, and to them say,
MERCUTIO
Stay not, be gone; live, and hereafter say,
MERCUTIO
I would thou wert so happy by thy stay,
MERCUTIO
That she doth give her sorrow so much sway,
MERCUTIO
all men's; and for a hand, and a foot, and a body,
MERCUTIO
shortly, for one would kill the other. Thou! why,
MERCUTIO
This gentleman, the prince's near ally,
MERCUTIO
It may be thought we held him carelessly,
MERCUTIO
I promise you, but for your company,
MERCUTIO
Hath sorted out a sudden day of joy,
MERCUTIO
The day to cheer and night's dank dew to dry,
MERCUTIO
That book in many's eyes doth share the glory,
MERCUTIO
Which is the god of my idolatry,
MERCUTIO
Begot of nothing but vain fantasy,
MERCUTIO
Banish'd the new-made bridegroom from the city,
MERCUTIO
Away to heaven, respective lenity,
MERCUTIO
It back to Tybalt, whose dexterity,
MERCUTIO
Who even in pure and vestal modesty,
MERCUTIO
Susan and she--God rest all Christian souls!--
Enter BENVOLIO and MERCUTIO
Together with the terror of the place,--
BALTHASAR
I'll lay fourteen of my teeth,--
BALTHASAR
I could not send it,--here it is again,--
BALTHASAR
I saw the wound, I saw it with mine eyes,--
BALTHASAR
Sweet flower, with flowers thy bridal bed I strew,--
BALTHASAR
[Aside] Villain and he be many miles asunder.--
BALTHASAR
That living mortals, hearing them, run mad:--
Re-enter some of the Watch, with BALTHASAR
O woe! thy canopy is dust and stones;--
PETER
I dreamt my lady came and found me dead--
PETER
I do beseech thee--
PETER
This is she--
PETER
If my heart's dear love--
PETER
And yet, to my teeth be it spoken, I have but four--
PETER
Out--
PETER
I will not budge for no man's pleasure, I.
Enter Nurse and PETER
And stint thou too, I pray thee, nurse, say I.
Exit PETER
Than empty tigers or the roaring sea.
PARIS
Doth hurry from the fatal cannon's womb.
PARIS
Some five and twenty years; and then we mask'd.
PARIS
Since this same wayward girl is so reclaim'd.
PARIS
I thought thy disposition better temper'd.
PARIS
[Aside] I would I knew not why it should be slow'd.
PARIS
So that my speed to Mantua there was stay'd.
PARIS
Unwieldy, slow, heavy and pale as lead.
PARIS
Torments him so, that he will sure run mad.
PARIS
And, on my lie, hath stol'n him home to bed.
PARIS
Ay, by my troth, the case may be amended.
PARIS
it on the drawer, when indeed there is no need.
Enter CAPULET, LADY CAPULET, and PARIS
Thus from my lips, by yours, my sin is purged.
Exeunt CAPULET and PARIS
Romeo that kill'd him, he is banished.
JULIET
And vice sometimes by action dignified.
JULIET
As dearly as my own,--be satisfied.
JULIET
Go ask his name: if he be married.
JULIET
Who here hath lain these two days buried.
JULIET
A plague o' both your houses! I am sped.
JULIET
Which the dark night hath so discovered.
JULIET
Myself condemned and myself excused.
JULIET
I aim'd so near, when I supposed you loved.
JULIET
I strike quickly, being moved.
JULIET
Upon the sweetest flower of all the field.
JULIET
So thou wilt woo; but else, not for the world.
JULIET
And, touching hers, make blessed my rude hand.
JULIET
This but begins the woe, others must end.
JULIET
Cannot choose but ever weep the friend.
JULIET
To-morrow will I send.
JULIET
To seek him here that means not to be found.
JULIET
Marry, sir, because silver hath a sweet sound.
JULIET
O blessed, blessed night! I am afeard.
JULIET
SCENE II. Capulet's orchard.
JULIET
SCENE V. Capulet's orchard.
JULIET
Here's Romeo's man; we found him in the churchyard.
JULIET
Love give me strength! and strength shall help afford.
JULIET
To Mantua, with my letters to thy lord.
JULIET
Thou fond mad man, hear me but speak a word.
JULIET
What must be shall be.
JULIET
For men so old as we to keep the peace.
JULIET
By playing it to me with so sour a face.
JULIET
Being spoke behind your back, than to your face.
JULIET
And what I spake, I spake it to my face.
JULIET
SCENE I. Verona. A public place.
JULIET
Peter, take my fan, and go before and apace.
JULIET
Nay, gentle Romeo, we must have you dance.
JULIET
Shalt with him hence.
JULIET
But Romeo's name speaks heavenly eloquence.
JULIET
sharp sauce.
JULIET
And too soon marr'd are those so early made.
JULIET
Ere we may think her ripe to be a bride.
JULIET
He shall not make me there a joyful bride.
JULIET
good quarrel, and the law on my side.
JULIET
To Juliet's grave; for there must I use thee.
JULIET
Do as thou wilt, for I have done with thee.
JULIET
That may convey my greetings, love, to thee.
JULIET
If they do see thee, they will murder thee.
JULIET
We follow thee.
JULIET
And all those twenty could but kill one life.
JULIET
A challenge, on my life.
JULIET
Soft! take me with you, take me with you, wife.
JULIET
Thou know'st my daughter's of a pretty age.
JULIET
Than those that have more cunning to be strange.
JULIET
Thy drugs are quick. Thus with a kiss I die.
JULIET
there rust, and let me die.
JULIET
This is the truth, or let Benvolio die.
JULIET
If all else fail, myself have power to die.
JULIET
That dreamers often lie.
JULIET
You lie.
JULIET
Then move not, while my prayer's effect I take.
JULIET
But thou art not quickly moved to strike.
JULIET
Either my eyesight fails, or thou look'st pale.
JULIET
Lest that thy love prove likewise variable.
Enter JULIET
What with a torch! muffle me, night, awhile.
Enter JULIET
So will ye, I am sure, that you love me.
Enter JULIET
And flourishes his blade in spite of me.
CAPULET
Come, go with me.
CAPULET
What wilt thou tell her, nurse? thou dost not mark me.
CAPULET
And gladly shunn'd who gladly fled from me.
CAPULET
Therefore thy kinsmen are no let to me.

A dog of the house of Montague moves me.

And this same needy man must sell it me.

Why, uncle, 'tis a shame.

CAPULET
You must contrary me! marry, 'tis time.
CAPULET
For sweet discourses in our time to come.
CAPULET
Is three long hours, yet she is not come.
CAPULET
Ah, that same pale hard-hearted wench, that Rosaline.
CAPULET
It is enough I may but call her mine.
CAPULET
That last is true; the sweeter rest was mine.
CAPULET
But new struck nine.
CAPULET
Till holy church incorporate two in one.
CAPULET
Marry, I will; and this is wisely done.
CAPULET
We'll measure them a measure, and be gone.
CAPULET
Therefore stay yet; thou need'st not to be gone.
CAPULET
My lord, we must entreat the time alone.
CAPULET
My dismal scene I needs must act alone.
CAPULET
Thou shalt not stir a foot to seek a foe.
CAPULET
Brief sounds determine of my weal or woe.
CAPULET
Call Peter, he will show thee where they are.
CAPULET
I would not for the world they saw thee here.
LADY CAPULET
And apprehend thee for a felon here.
LADY CAPULET
This afternoon, sir? well, she shall be there.
LADY CAPULET
Stop there, stop there.
LADY CAPULET
This is not Romeo, he's some other where.
LADY CAPULET
Indeed, I should have ask'd you that before.
LADY CAPULET
It helps not, it prevails not: talk no more.
LADY CAPULET
That when she dies with beauty dies her store.
LADY CAPULET
Here in the churchyard; yet I will adventure.
LADY CAPULET
For, well you know, this is a pitiful case.
LADY CAPULET
I would adventure for such merchandise.
LADY CAPULET
to the goose, proves thee far and wide a broad goose.
LADY CAPULET
I am the youngest of that name, for fault of a worse.
LADY CAPULET
Some comfort, nurse.
LADY CAPULET
Is longer than the tale thou dost excuse.
LADY CAPULET
To supper; to our house.
LADY CAPULET
SCENE II. Hall in Capulet's house.
LADY CAPULET
SCENE V. A hall in Capulet's house.
LADY CAPULET
SCENE IV. A room in Capulet's house.
LADY CAPULET
Supper is done, and we shall come too late.
LADY CAPULET
Let me dispute with thee of thy estate.
LADY CAPULET
For it was bad enough before their spite.
LADY CAPULET
O, let us hence; I stand on sudden haste.
LADY CAPULET
Now do you know the reason of this haste.
Enter LADY CAPULET
Thou art thyself, though not a Montague.
Enter LADY CAPULET
Anon, good nurse! Sweet Montague, be true.
Enter CAPULET
I have.

TYBALT
To turn your households' rancour to pure love.
TYBALT

TYBALT
The valiant Paris seeks you for his love.
TYBALT
But thankful even for hate, that is meant love.
TYBALT
Tell me in sadness, who is that you love.
TYBALT
And bad'st me bury love.
Enter TYBALT
Unless good counsel may the cause remove.
ACT V
Or in my cell there would she kill herself.
GREGORY
Henceforward do your messages yourself.
GREGORY
Arise; one knocks; good Romeo, hide thyself.
GREGORY
It is an honour that I dream not of.
GREGORY
Yet I should kill thee with much cherishing.
GREGORY
Too great oppression for a tender thing.

Thou talk'st of nothing.

And shake the yoke of inauspicious stars
Talk not to me, for I'll not speak a word:
Enter CAPULET, LADY CAPULET, and others
I'll give thee armour to keep off that word:
Enter ROMEO, MERCUTIO, BENVOLIO, with five or six Maskers, Torch-bearers, and others
Ah, where's my man? give me some aqua vitae:
Enter TYBALT and others
Or never after look me in the face:
Enter SAMPSON and GREGORY, of the house of Capulet, armed with swords and bucklers
Than the death-darting eye of cockatrice:
Soon sleep in quiet. O, how my heart abhors
Say either, and I'll stay the circumstance:
That's as much as to say, such a case as yours
Or by the break of day disguised from hence:
But my true love is grown to such excess
And bear this work of heaven with patience:
Is loathsome in his own deliciousness
As I hate hell, all Montagues, and thee:
a fool's paradise, as they say, it were a very gross
Nightly she sings on yon pomegranate-tree:
Enter three or four Servingmen, with spits, logs, and baskets
And all things shall be well, I warrant thee, wife:
Of Tybalt deaf to peace, but that he tilts
And she, there dead, that Romeo's faithful wife:
Enter PRINCE, with Attendants
To bid me trudge:
To help me sort such needful ornaments
That thou her maid art far more fair than she:
Hold; get you gone, be strong and prosperous
I am a-weary, give me leave awhile:
Chorus
Graze where you will you shall not house with me:
Draws
Stay, then; I'll go alone. Fear comes upon me:
If good, thou shamest the music of sweet news
I'll call them back again to comfort me:
Whose misadventured piteous overthrows
It is my soul that calls upon my name:
Nor that is not the lark, whose notes do beat
Thou and these woes were all for Rosaline:
other reason but because thou hast hazel eyes: what
In dear employment: therefore hence, be gone:
A greater power than we can contradict
Such as would please: 'tis gone, 'tis gone, 'tis gone:
But passion lends them power, time means, to meet
Because their breaths with sweetmeats tainted are:
Romeo and Juliet
Every good hap to you that chances here:
me a piece of marchpane; and, as thou lovest me, let
To meet her new-beloved any where:
Second Capulet
But saying o'er what I have said before:
Then plainly know my heart's dear love is set
To call hers exquisite, in question more:
Thou art not conquer'd; beauty's ensign yet
Shall keep his native progress, but surcease:
Let's see for means: O mischief, thou art swift
Weeping and wailing over Tybalt's corse:
They fight
Revolts from true birth, stumbling on abuse:
They fight
Ah, sirrah, by my fay, it waxes late:
What torch is yond, that vainly lends his light
And in the taste confounds the appetite:
O Lord, I could have stay'd here all the night
And yet I wish but for the thing I have:
For thou wilt lie upon the wings of night
To follow this fair corse unto her grave:
And never from this palace of dim night
Thou pout'st upon thy fortune and thy love:
At my poor house look to behold this night
I'll look to like, if looking liking move:
And in this state she gallops night by night
Herself poised with herself in either eye:
For that which thou hast heard me speak to-night
To cease thy suit, and leave me to my grief:
Was stay'd by accident, and yesternight
For I come hither arm'd against myself:
Unworthy as she is, that we have wrought
because musicians have no gold for sounding:
Of dear import, and the neglecting it
Raise up the Montagues: some others search:
to your French slop. You gave us the counterfeit
Being our kinsman, if we revel much:
And all this day an unaccustom'd spirit
Good heart, and, i' faith, I will tell her as much:
And wish his mistress were that kind of fruit
One desperate grief cures with another's languish:
Exit
Their course of love, the tidings of her death:
Exit
Turn to another, this shall slay them both:
Exit
To be a virtuous and well-govern'd youth:
Exit
Must climb a bird's nest soon when it is dark:
Exit
He ran this way, and leap'd this orchard wall:
Exit
That you run mad, seeing that she is well:
Exit
Bear hence this body and attend our will:
Exit
The unlucky manage of this fatal brawl:
Exit
Therefore be patient, take no note of him:
Or my true heart with treacherous revolt
Stand up, stand up; stand, and you be a man:
Servant
me like men:
Servant
Doth couch his limbs, there golden sleep doth reign:
Servant
We shall be short in our provision:
Servant
Who nothing hurt withal hiss'd him in scorn:
Servant
Till I conveniently could send to Romeo:
Enter a Servant
I have more care to stay than will to go:
Second Servant
But thou slew'st Tybalt; there are thou happy too:
Second Servant
Of death, contagion, and unnatural sleep:
Second Servant
Why, I am glad on't; this is well: stand up:
Exit Second Servant
Let not thy nurse lie with thee in thy chamber:
First Servant
Well, he may chance to do some good on her:
First Servant
That we have had no time to move our daughter:
Exit First Servant
Poison hath residence and medicine power:
Is very good meat in lent
Here, sir, a ring she bid me give you, sir:
And see how one another lends content
And strew this hungry churchyard with thy limbs:
Exeunt
Ay, madam, from the reach of these my hands:
Exeunt
Like damned guilty deeds to sinners' minds:
Exeunt
Which once untangled, much misfortune bodes:
Exeunt
In herbs, plants, stones, and their true qualities:
Exeunt
Nor tears nor prayers shall purchase out abuses:
Exeunt
Send for the county; go tell him of this:
Exeunt
This holy shrine, the gentle fine is this:
Exeunt
I am too bold, 'tis not to me she speaks:
Exeunt
From forth day's path and Titan's fiery wheels:
Exeunt
Or, wanting that, with tears distill'd by moans:
as pale as any clout in the versal world. Doth not
Among a sisterhood of holy nuns:
Well, you have made a simple choice; you know not
Being vex'd a sea nourish'd with lovers' tears:
Which the commission of thy years and art
Go, tell the prince: run to the Capulets:
now art thou sociable, now art thou Romeo; now art
This doth not so, for she divideth us:
Nor arm, nor face, nor any other part
For you and I are past our dancing days:
My very friend, hath got his mortal hurt
So shalt thou show me friendship. Take thou that:
Of a despised life closed in my breast
He told me Paris should have married Juliet:
Thou wast never with me for any thing when thou wast
Of an old tear that is not wash'd off yet:
I hear some noise. Lady, come from that nest
And therefore thou mayst think my 'havior light:
Which thou wilt propagate, to have it prest
And makes himself an artificial night:
Thy wit is a very bitter sweeting; it is a most
Hark ye, your Romeo will be here at night:
the pantry, and every thing in extremity. I must
I have no joy of this contract to-night:
Her chariot is an empty hazel-nut
That copest with death himself to scape from it:
Through fair Verona; find those persons out
I gave thee mine before thou didst request it:
Go, sirrah, trudge about
Brags of his substance, not of ornament:
'Tis well thou art not fish; if thou hadst, thou
And turn'd that black word death to banishment:
tying his new shoes with old riband? and yet thou
We will have vengeance for it, fear thou not:
Arms, take your last embrace! and, lips, O you
O, thou art deceived; I would have made it short:
You shall find me apt enough to that, sir, an you
The unreasonable fury of a beast:
Then have at you with my wit! I will dry-beat you
It fits, when such a villain is a guest:
Should in the furthest east begin to draw
[Aside] For all this same, I'll hide me hereabout:
JULIET appears above at a window
And trust me, love, in my eye so do you:
By holy marriage: when and where and how
For even the day before, she broke her brow:
I pray thee, chide not; she whom I love now
To marry Paris: Wednesday is to-morrow:
She is not fourteen. How long is it now
Thou shalt be logger-head. Good faith, 'tis day:
[Within] Let me come in, and you shall know
For this time, all the rest depart away:
Get you to bed; faith, You'll be sick to-morrow
I'll to the friar, to know his remedy:
She hath forsworn to love, and in that vow
If thou dost love, pronounce it faithfully:
Night's candles are burnt out, and jocund day
Staying for thine to keep him company:
Not yet enjoy'd: so tedious is this day
That he shall soon keep Tybalt company:
O son! the night before thy wedding-day
But I'll be hanged, sir, if he wear your livery:
Of her awaking, here untimely lay
The date is out of such prolixity:
The excuse that thou dost make in this delay
I am not I, if there be such an I;
[Aside to GREGORY] Is the law of our side, if I say
Anon comes one with light to ope the tomb;
'Tis the way
The earth that's nature's mother is her tomb;
Marry, farewell! I pray you, sir, what saucy
Thy husband in thy bosom there lies dead;
Evermore showering? In one little body
For whose dear sake thou wast but lately dead;
You shall have none ill, sir; for I'll try if they
Wife, go you to her ere you go to bed;
Helen and Hero hildings and harlots; Thisbe a grey
He made you for a highway to my bed;
widow of Vitravio; Signior Placentio and his lovely
Come, cords, come, nurse; I'll to my wedding-bed;
Fain would I dwell on form, fain, fain deny
Tybalt is gone, and Romeo banished;
It cannot countervail the exchange of joy
Speak but one rhyme, and I am satisfied;
Ah, Juliet, if the measure of thy joy
Of stout Mercutio, and then Tybalt fled;
Apothecary
Prick'd from the lazy finger of a maid;
Apothecary
That God had lent us but this only child;
Enter Apothecary
My child is yet a stranger in the world;
But if thou, jealous, dost return to pry
For Juliet's sake, for her sake, rise and stand;
For beauty starved with her severity
