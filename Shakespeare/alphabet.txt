A bawd, a bawd, a bawd! so ho!
A beggarly account of empty boxes,
A bump as big as a young cockerel's stone;
A challenge, on my life.
A choking gall and a preserving sweet.
A cold and drowsy humour, for no pulse
A crutch, a crutch! why call you for a sword?
A damned saint, an honourable villain!
A dateless bargain to engrossing death!
A dog of that house shall move me to stand: I will
A dog of the house of Montague moves me.
A dram of poison, such soon-speeding gear
a fool's paradise, as they say, it were a very gross
A fortnight and odd days.
A gentleman of noble parentage,
A gentleman, nurse, that loves to hear himself talk,
A gentler judgment vanish'd from his lips,
A glooming peace this morning with it brings;
A grave? O no! a lantern, slaughter'd youth,
A great suspicion: stay the friar too.
A greater power than we can contradict
A hall, a hall! give room! and foot it, girls.
A jealous hood, a jealous hood!
A lightning before death: O, how may I
A lover may bestride the gossamer
A madman's mercy bade thee run away.
A man, young lady! lady, such a man
A most courteous exposition.
A pack of blessings lights up upon thy back;
A pair of star-cross'd lovers take their life;
A parlous knock; and it cried bitterly:
A peevish self-will'd harlotry it is.
A piteous corse, a bloody piteous corse;
A plague o' both your houses! I am sped.
A precious ring, a ring that I must use
A rhyme I learn'd even now
A right fair mark, fair coz, is soonest hit.
A right good mark-man! And she's fair I love.
A sail, a sail!
A sin-absolver, and my friend profess'd,
A sleeping potion; which so took effect
A thing like death to chide away this shame,
A thousand times good night!
A thousand times the worse, to want thy light.
A torch for me: let wantons light of heart
A troubled mind drave me to walk abroad;
a very good blade! a very tall man! a very good
A villain that is hither come in spite,
A visor for a visor! what care I
A whining mammet, in her fortune's tender,
A whispering tale in a fair lady's ear,
A' was a merry man--took up the child:
Abate thy valour in the acting it.
Above the clouds, as high as heaven itself?

An envious thrust from Tybalt hit the life
An honour! were not I thine only nurse,
An hour but married, Tybalt murdered,
An I might live to see thee married once,
An I were so apt to quarrel as thou art, any man

An if thou couldst, thou couldst not make him live;
An if you leave me so, you do me wrong.

An open et caetera, thou a poperin pear!
An she agree, within her scope of choice
An you be mine, I'll give you to my friend;
An you re us and fa us, you note us.

And 'twixt them rushes; underneath whose arm
And a good lady, and a wise and virtuous
And all combined, save what thou must combine
And all my fortunes at thy foot I'll lay
And all the better is it for the maid:
And all things change them to the contrary.
And all things shall be well, I warrant thee, wife:
And all this day an unaccustom'd spirit
And all those twenty could but kill one life.
And an old hare hoar,
And apprehend thee for a felon here.
And art thou changed? pronounce this sentence then,
and as I told you, my young lady bade me inquire you
And bad'st me bury love.
And bakes the elflocks in foul sluttish hairs,
And bear this work of heaven with patience:
And beg your pardon: pardon, I beseech you!
And being thus frighted swears a prayer or two
And bid her hasten all the house to bed,
And bid her, mark you me, on Wednesday next--
And bid him come to take his last farewell.
And bid me stand aloof, and so I did:
And breathed such life with kisses in my lips,
And bring in cloudy night immediately.
And bring thee cords made like a tackled stair;
And but one word with one of us? couple it with
And but thou love me, let them find me here:
And by and by my master drew on him;
And cruel death hath catch'd it from my sight!
And death's pale flag is not advanced there.
And death, not Romeo, take my maidenhead!
And do not interrupt me in my course.
And doleful dumps the mind oppress,
And doth it give me such a sight as this?
And drink it off; and, if you had the strength
And ere this hand, by thee to Romeo seal'd,
And fall upon the ground, as I do now,
And fear'st to die? famine is in thy cheeks,
And fearfully did menace me with death,
And find delight writ there with beauty's pen;
And finding him, the searchers of the town,
And fire-eyed fury be my conduct now!
And flecked darkness like a drunkard reels
And flourishes his blade in spite of me.
And follow thee my lord throughout the world.
And for that name which is no part of thee
And for that offence
And from her womb children of divers kind
And from my soul too;
And gave him what becomed love I might,
And gladly shunn'd who gladly fled from me.
And go, Sir Paris; every one prepare
And he shall signify from time to time
And he will make the face of heaven so fine
And hear the sentence of your moved prince.
And her immortal part with angels lives.
And here he writes that he did buy a poison
And here I stand, both to impeach and purge
And here is come to do some villanous shame
And hereabouts he dwells,--which late I noted
And hide me with a dead man in his shroud;
And hire post-horses; I will hence to-night.
And hire those horses; I'll be with thee straight.
And his to me:
And hither shall he come: and he and I
And I am nothing slow to slack his haste.
And I am proof against their enmity.
And I for winking at your discords too
And I will do it without fear or doubt,
And I will make thee think thy swan a crow.
And I will take thy word: yet if thou swear'st,
And I'll believe thee.
And I'll no longer be a Capulet.
And I'll still stay, to have thee still forget,
And if he hear thee, thou wilt anger him.
And ill-beseeming semblance for a feast.
And in his needy shop a tortoise hung,
And in his wisdom hastes our marriage,
And in my temper soften'd valour's steel!
And in the taste confounds the appetite:
And in their triumph die, like fire and powder,
And in this borrow'd likeness of shrunk death
And in this state she gallops night by night
And is it not well served in to a sweet goose?
And it mis-sheathed in my daughter's bosom!
And joy comes well in such a needy time:
And Juliet bleeding, warm, and newly dead,
And keep her at my cell till Romeo come;
And know their spring, their head, their
And lead you even to death: meantime forbear,
And learn me how to lose a winning match,
And leave him all; life, living, all is Death's.
And let mischance be slave to patience.
And let the nurse this night sit up with you;
And light thee on thy way to Mantua:
And like her most whose merit most shall be:
And little mouse, every unworthy thing,
And made Verona's ancient citizens
And madly play with my forefather's joints?
And make her airy tongue more hoarse than mine,
And makes himself an artificial night:
And may not wear them. O, here comes my nurse,
And more inconstant than the wind, who wooes
And needly will be rank'd with other griefs,
And never from this palace of dim night
And never trouble Peter for the matter.
And none but fools do wear it; cast it off.
And not impute this yielding to light love,
And now falls on her bed; and then starts up,
And palm to palm is holy palmers' kiss.
And Paris too. Come, I'll dispose of thee
And pay no worship to the garish sun.
And pity 'tis you lived at odds so long.
And pluck the mangled Tybalt from his shroud?
And presently took post to tell it you:
And private in his chamber pens himself,
And quench the fire, the room is grown too hot.
And reason coldly of your grievances,
And Romeo dead; and Juliet, dead before,
And sails upon the bosom of the air.
And say'st thou yet that exile is not death?
And see how he will take it at your hands.
And see how one another lends content
And shake the yoke of inauspicious stars
And she as much in love, her means much less
And she brings news; and every tongue that speaks
And she shall scant show well that now shows best.
And she steal love's sweet bait from fearful hooks:
And she was wean'd,--I never shall forget it,--
And she, there dead, that Romeo's faithful wife:
And she, too desperate, would not go with me,
And shrieks like mandrakes' torn out of the earth,
And since that time it is eleven years;
And sleeps again. This is that very Mab
And smilest upon the stroke that murders me.
And so did I.
And so did I:--Well, we were born to die.
And so, good Capulet,--which name I tender
And soar with them above a common bound.
And sometime comes she with a tithe-pig's tail
And soundly too: your houses!
And stay thy lady too that lives in thee,
And stay, good nurse, behind the abbey wall:
And steal immortal blessing from her lips,
And steep'd in blood? Ah, what an unkind hour
And stint thou too, I pray thee, nurse, say I.
And stole into the covert of the wood:
And strew this hungry churchyard with thy limbs:
And that bare vowel 'I' shall poison more
And that my master slew him.
And that the lean abhorred monster keeps
And that the trunk may be discharged of breath
And that we have a curse in having her:
And the continuance of their parents' rage,
And the demesnes that there adjacent lie,
And the place death, considering who thou art,
And the rank poison of the old will die.
And then awake as from a pleasant sleep.
And then down falls again.
And then dreams he of cutting foreign throats,
And then dreams he of smelling out a suit;
And then I ran away to call the watch.
And then in post he came from Mantua
And then my husband--God be with his soul!
And then to have a wretched puling fool,
And then will I be general of your woes,
And then, I hope, thou wilt be satisfied.
And there an end. But what say you to Thursday?
And there die strangled ere my Romeo comes?
And there I am. Where is my Romeo?
And there she shall at Friar Laurence' cell
And therefore hath the wind-swift Cupid wings.
And therefore have I little talk'd of love;
And therefore thou mayst think my 'havior light:
And these, who often drown'd could never die,
And this distilled liquor drink thou off;
And this same needy man must sell it me.
And this shall free thee from this present shame;
And thou and Romeo press one heavy bier!
And thou art wedded to calamity.
And thou dismember'd with thine own defence.
And threatened me with death, going in the vault,
And to 't they go like lightning, for, ere I
And too soon marr'd are those so early made.
And trust me, love, in my eye so do you:
And turn'd that black word death to banishment:
And turns it to exile; there art thou happy:
And Tybalt calls; and then on Romeo cries,
And Tybalt's dead, that would have slain my husband:
And usest none in that true use indeed
And vice sometimes by action dignified.
And we mean well in going to this mask;
And weep ye now, seeing she is advanced
And what I spake, I spake it to my face.
And what love can do that dares love attempt;
And what obscured in this fair volume lies
And what to?
And where care lodges, sleep will never lie;
And where the worser is predominant,
And why, my lady wisdom? hold your tongue,
and will speak more in a minute than he will stand
And wish his mistress were that kind of fruit
And with a silk thread plucks it back again,
And with my child my joys are buried.
And with this knife I'll help it presently.
And world's exile is death: then banished,
And yet 'not proud,' mistress minion, you,
And yet I wish but for the thing I have:
And yet I would it were to give again.
And yet no further than a wanton's bird;
And yet no man like he doth grieve my heart.
And yet not fall; so light is vanity.
And yet, I warrant, it had upon its brow
And yet, to my teeth be it spoken, I have but four--
And you be not, hang, beg, starve, die in
And young affection gapes to be his heir;
And yours, close fighting ere I did approach:
And, as he fell, did Romeo turn and fly.
And, being anger'd, puffs away from thence,
And, if thou darest, I'll give thee remedy.
And, if we meet, we shall not scape a brawl;
And, in despite, I'll cram thee with more food!
And, in strong proof of chastity well arm'd,
And, in this rage, with some great kinsman's bone,
And, Montague, come you this afternoon,
And, on my lie, hath stol'n him home to bed.
And, pretty fool, it stinted and said 'Ay.'
And, to say truth, Verona brags of him
And, to sink in it, should you burden love;
And, touching hers, make blessed my rude hand.
And, with a martial scorn, with one hand beats
And, with wild looks, bid me devise some mean
Anon comes one with light to ope the tomb;
Anon!
Anon!
Anon, anon!

As I hate hell, all Montagues, and thee:

As I remember, this should be the house.

As is a winged messenger of heaven
As is the bud bit with an envious worm,

As Phaethon would whip you to the west,
As rich shall Romeo's by his lady's lie;
As signal that thou hear'st something approach.
As that is desperate which we would prevent.
As that of true and faithful Juliet.
As that the villain lives which slaughter'd him.
As that vast shore wash'd with the farthest sea,
As violently as hasty powder fired
As will disperse itself through all the veins
As with a club, dash out my desperate brains?
As yonder lady o'er her fellows shows.

Beautiful tyrant! fiend angelical!

Because he married me before to Romeo?
Because it is an enemy to thee;
because musicians have no gold for sounding:
Because their breaths with sweetmeats tainted are:

Begot of nothing but vain fantasy,
Beguiled, divorced, wronged, spited, slain!

Being black put us in mind they hide the fair;
Being but heavy, I will bear the light.

Being holiday, the beggar's shop is shut.
Being in night, all this is but a dream,
Being loose, unfirm, with digging up of graves,
Being our kinsman, if we revel much:
Being purged, a fire sparkling in lovers' eyes;
Being spoke behind your back, than to your face.
Being tasted, slays all senses with the heart.

Beshrew your heart for sending me about,
Betroth'd and would have married her perforce
Bid a sick man in sadness make his will:
Bid her devise

Black and portentous must this humour prove,
blind bow-boy's butt-shaft: and is he a man to
Blind is his love and best befits the dark.
Bliss be upon you! Tell me, good my friend,
Blister'd be thy tongue
Blubbering and weeping, weeping and blubbering.
Bondage is hoarse, and may not speak aloud;
bones, their bones!
Both by myself and many other friends:
Both you and I; for Romeo is exiled:
both your houses! 'Zounds, a dog, a rat, a mouse, a

Brother, I'll go and bring it thee.
But 'banished' to kill me?--'banished'?
But 'tis no wit to go.
But a hare that is hoar
But all so soon as the all-cheering sun
But by and by comes back to Romeo,
But chiefly to take thence from her dead finger
But come, young waverer, come, go with me,
But every man betake him to his legs.
But fettle your fine joints 'gainst Thursday next,
but first let me tell ye, if ye should lead her into
But for the sunset of my brother's son
But he which bore my letter, Friar John,
But he, his own affections' counsellor,
But He, that hath the steerage of my course,
But heaven keeps his part in eternal life.
But I can give thee more:
But I will watch you from such watching now.
But I will write again to Mantua,
But I'll amerce you with so strong a fine
But I'll be hanged, sir, if he wear your livery:
But I, a maid, die maiden-widowed.
But if thou, jealous, dost return to pry
But in that crystal scales let there be weigh'd
But let them measure us by what they will;
But look thou stay not till the watch be set,
But love from love, toward school with heavy looks.
But love thee better than thou canst devise,
But Montague is bound as well as I,
But much of grief shows still some want of wit.
But my true love is grown to such excess
But new struck nine.
But no more deep will I endart mine eye
But not possess'd it, and, though I am sold,
But now I see this one is one too much,
But now I'll tell thee joyful tidings, girl.
But now, my lord, what say you to my suit?
But old folks, many feign as they were dead;
But one thing to rejoice and solace in,
But one, poor one, one poor and loving child,
But passion lends them power, time means, to meet
But purgatory, torture, hell itself.
But Romeo may not: more validity,
But Romeo may not; he is banished:
But Romeo's name speaks heavenly eloquence.
But sadly tell me who.
But saying o'er what I have said before:
But send him back.
But she's best married that dies married young.
But thankful even for hate, that is meant love.
But that a joy past joy calls out on me,
But that thou overheard'st, ere I was ware,
But the true ground of all these piteous woes
But then a noise did scare me from the tomb;
But thou art not quickly moved to strike.
But thou shalt hear it: whistle then to me,
But thou slew'st Tybalt; there are thou happy too:
But to be frank, and give it thee again.
But to himself so secret and so close,
But to his foe supposed he must complain,
But to rejoice in splendor of mine own.
But to the earth some special good doth give,
But trust me, gentleman, I'll prove more true
But when I came, some minute ere the time
But where unbruised youth with unstuff'd brain
But with a rear-ward following Tybalt's death,
But woo her, gentle Paris, get her heart,
But you shall bear the burden soon at night.

Came I to take her from her kindred's vault;

Came to this vault to die, and lie with Juliet.

Five times in that ere once in our five wits.
Flies may do this, but I from this must fly:
Flower as she was, deflowered by him.
Fly hence, and leave me: think upon these gone;
Follow me close, for I will speak to them.
For 'tis a throne where honour may be crown'd
For 'twas your heaven she should be advanced:
For beauty starved with her severity
For blood of ours, shed blood of Montague.
For doting, not for loving, pupil mine.
For even the day before, she broke her brow:
For exile hath more terror in his look,
For fair without the fair within to hide:
For fear of that, I still will stay with thee;
For he hath still been tried a holy man.
For here lies Juliet, and her beauty makes
For here we need it not.
For I am proverb'd with a grandsire phrase;
For I come hither arm'd against myself:
For I had then laid wormwood to my dug,
For I have need of many orisons
For I ne'er saw true beauty till this night.
for I was come to the whole depth of my tale; and
For I will raise her statue in pure gold;
For in a minute there are many days:
For it excels your first: or if it did not,
For it was bad enough before their spite.
For Juliet's sake, for her sake, rise and stand;
For men so old as we to keep the peace.
For never was a story of more woe
For nothing can be ill, if she be well.
For nought so vile that on the earth doth live
For now, these hot days, is the mad blood stirring.
For saints have hands that pilgrims' hands do touch,
For shame, bring Juliet forth; her lord is come.
For so he said he would: I hear him near.
For still thy eyes, which I may call the sea,
For stony limits cannot hold love out,
For such a wish! he was not born to shame:
For sweet discourses in our time to come.
For that which thou hast heard me speak to-night
For then she could stand alone; nay, by the rood,
For then thou canst not pass to Mantua;
For then, I hope, thou wilt not keep him long,
For this alliance may so happy prove,
for this drivelling love is like a great natural,
For this night's watching.
For this time, all the rest depart away:
For this, being smelt, with that part cheers each part;
For thou wilt lie upon the wings of night
For though fond nature bids us an lament,
For Venus smiles not in a house of tears.
For what, I pray thee?
For who is living, if those two are gone?
For whom, and not for Tybalt, Juliet pined.
For whose dear sake thou wast but lately dead;
For you and I are past our dancing days:
for you. It is 'music with her silver sound,'
For your broken shin.
For, by my soul, I'll ne'er acknowledge thee,
For, by your leaves, you shall not stay alone
For, hark you, Tybalt being slain so late,
For, I am sure, you have your hands full all,
For, well you know, this is a pitiful case.
Forbidden bandying in Verona streets:
Forgetting any other home but this.
Forgive me, cousin! Ah, dear Juliet,

From ancient grudge break to new mutiny,
From forth day's path and Titan's fiery wheels:
From forth the fatal loins of these two foes
From love's weak childish bow she lives unharm'd.
From off the battlements of yonder tower;
From this world-wearied flesh. Eyes, look your last!
Full half an hour.
Full soon the canker death eats up that plant.
Gallop apace, you fiery-footed steeds,
Gentle Mercutio, put thy rapier up.
Gentlemen, for shame, forbear this outrage!
Gentlemen, good den: a word with one of you.
Get me an iron crow, and bring it straight
Get thee to bed, and rest; for thou hast need.
Get you to bed; faith, You'll be sick to-morrow
Give me a case to put my visage in:
Give me a torch: I am not for this ambling;
Give me my Romeo; and, when he shall die,
Give me my sin again.
Give me some present counsel, or, behold,
Give me that mattock and the wrenching iron.
Give me the letter; I will look on it.
Give me the light: upon thy life, I charge thee,
Give me those flowers. Do as I bid thee, go.
Give me thy hand; 'tis late: farewell; good night.
Give me thy torch, boy: hence, and stand aloof:
Give me, give me! O, tell not me of fear!
Go ask his name: if he be married.
Go before, nurse: commend me to thy lady;
Go hence, to have more talk of these sad things;
Go hence; good night; and here stands all your state:
Go in: and tell my lady I am gone,
Go thither; and, with unattainted eye,
Go thou to Juliet, help to deck up her;
Go to, go to;
Go to; I say you shall.
Go waken Juliet, go and trim her up;
Go with me to the vault.
Go you to Juliet ere you go to bed,
Go, be gone.
Go, get thee hence, for I will not away.
Go, get thee to thy love, as was decreed,
Go, girl, seek happy nights to happy days.
Go, nurse, go with her: we'll to church to-morrow.
Go, sirrah, trudge about
Go, some of you, whoe'er you find attach.
Go, tell the prince: run to the Capulets:
Go, then; for 'tis in vain
Go, you cot-quean, go,
Go; I'll to dinner: hie you to the cell.
God forbid! Where's this girl? What, Juliet!
God gi' god-den. I pray, sir, can you read?
God in heaven bless her!
God join'd my heart and Romeo's, thou our hands;
God Pardon him! I do, with all my heart;
God pardon sin! wast thou with Rosaline?
God save the mark!--here on his manly breast:
God shield I should disturb devotion!
God ye good den, fair gentlewoman.
God ye good morrow, gentlemen.
God's bread! it makes me mad:
Going to find a bare-foot brother out
Good even to my ghostly confessor.
Good father, I beseech you on my knees,
Good gentle youth, tempt not a desperate man;
Good heart, and, i' faith, I will tell her as much:
Good heart, at what?
Good king of cats, nothing but one of your nine
Good morrow to you both. What counterfeit did I give you?
Good morrow, father.
Good night, good night! as sweet repose and rest
Good night, good night! parting is such
Good night.
Good night:
Good Peter, to hide her face; for her fan's the
Good pilgrim, you do wrong your hand too much,
Good prudence; smatter with your gossips, go.

Grief of my son's exile hath stopp'd her breath:
Griefs of mine own lie heavy in my breast,
Groan! why, no.
Ha! let me see her: out, alas! she's cold:
Ha, banishment! be merciful, say 'death;'

Hang thee, young baggage! disobedient wretch!
Haply some poison yet doth hang on them,
Happily met, my lady and my wife!
Happiness courts thee in her best array;
Hark ye, your Romeo will be here at night:
Hark, how they knock! Who's there? Romeo, arise;
Hast thou met with him? Send thy man away.
Hast thou no letters to me from the friar?
Hast thou slain Tybalt? wilt thou slay thyself?
Hath been my kinsman! O sweet Juliet,
Hath Death lain with thy wife. There she lies,
Hath had no notice of these accidents;
Hath had no power yet upon thy beauty:
Hath not so green, so quick, so fair an eye
Hath Romeo slain himself? say thou but 'I,'
Hath sent a letter to his father's house.
Hath slain ten thousand Tybalts. Tybalt's death
Hath sorted out a sudden day of joy,
Hath thwarted our intents. Come, come away.
Hath wash'd thy sallow cheeks for Rosaline!
Have at thee, coward!
have fought with the men, I will be cruel with the
Have I thought long to see this morning's face,
Have lost a brace of kinsmen: all are punish'd.
Have my old feet stumbled at graves! Who's there?
Have not saints lips, and holy palmers too?
Have they been merry! which their keepers call
Have thrice disturb'd the quiet of our streets,
Have you deliver'd to her our decree?
Have you got leave to go to shrift to-day?
Have you importuned him by any means?
Having displeased my father, to Laurence' cell,
Having some business, do entreat her eyes
He bears him like a portly gentleman;
He came with flowers to strew his lady's grave;
He climbs the wall, and leaps down within it
He goeth down
He heareth not, he stirreth not, he moveth not;
He is a kinsman to the Montague;
He is wise;
He jests at scars that never felt a wound.
He lent me counsel and I lent him eyes.
He made you for a highway to my bed;
He ran this way, and leap'd this orchard wall:
He shall be endured:
He shall not make me there a joyful bride.
He swung about his head and cut the winds,
He that is strucken blind cannot forget
He told me Paris should have married Juliet:
He'll fright you up, i' faith. Will it not be?
Hear me with patience but to speak a word.

Help me into some house, Benvolio,

Hence from Verona art thou banished:
hence to wait; I beseech you, follow straight.
Hence will I to my ghostly father's cell,
Hence-banished is banish'd from the world,
Henceforth I never will be Romeo.
Henceforward do your messages yourself.
Henceforward I am ever ruled by you.
Her blood is settled, and her joints are stiff;
Her body sleeps in Capel's monument,
Her chariot is an empty hazel-nut
Her eye discourses; I will answer it.
Her mother is the lady of the house,
Her nurse is privy: and, if aught in this
Her vestal livery is but sick and green
Her wagon-spokes made of long spiders' legs,
Her wagoner a small grey-coated gnat,
Her whip of cricket's bone, the lash of film,
Here are the beetle brows shall blush for me.
Here comes Romeo, here comes Romeo.
Here comes the furious Tybalt back again.
Here comes the lady: O, so light a foot
Here comes your father; tell him so yourself,
Here in my house do him disparagement:
Here in the churchyard; yet I will adventure.
Here in this city visiting the sick,
Here in Verona, ladies of esteem,
Here is a friar, and slaughter'd Romeo's man;
Here is a friar, that trembles, sighs and weeps:
Here lives a caitiff wretch would sell it him.'
Here were the servants of your adversary,
Here's goodly gear!
Here's much to do with hate, but more with love.
Here's one, a friend, and one that knows you well.
Here's Romeo's man; we found him in the churchyard.
Here's such a coil! come, what says Romeo?
Here's to my love!
Here, sir, a ring she bid me give you, sir:
Herself poised with herself in either eye:
Hie to high fortune! Honest nurse, farewell.
Hie to your chamber: I'll find Romeo
Hie you to church; I must another way,
Hie you, make haste, for it grows very late.
His agile arm beats down their fatal points,
His fault concludes but what the law should end,
His help to crave, and my dear hap to tell.

his pencil, and the painter with his nets; but I am

Hold, take these keys, and fetch more spices, nurse.
Hold, take this letter; early in the morning
Hold, then; go home, be merry, give consent
Hold, there is forty ducats: let me have
Hold, Tybalt! good Mercutio!
Hold; get you gone, be strong and prosperous
Holding thine ear close to the hollow ground;
Holy Franciscan friar! brother, ho!
Holy Saint Francis, what a change is here!
Honest goodfellows, ah, put up, put up;
Hood my unmann'd blood, bating in my cheeks,
how art thou fishified! Now is he for the numbers
How art thou out of breath, when thou hast breath
How camest thou hither, tell me, and wherefore?
How canst thou try them so?
How doth my lady? Is my father well?
How fares my Juliet? that I ask again;
How if, when I am laid into the tomb,
How is't, my soul? let's talk; it is not day.
How long hath he been there?
How long is't now since last yourself and I
How much salt water thrown away in waste,
How nice the quarrel was, and urged withal
How now! a conduit, girl? what, still in tears?
How now! who calls?
How now, how now, chop-logic! What is this?
How now, my headstrong! where have you been gadding?
How oft when men are at the point of death
How shall that faith return again to earth,
How should they, when that wise men have no eyes?
How silver-sweet sound lovers' tongues by night,
How stands your disposition to be married?
how to choose a man: Romeo! no, not he; though his
How well my comfort is revived by this!
How! turn thy back and run?
How! will she none? doth she not give us thanks?
Howlings attend it: how hast thou the heart,
Hunting thee hence with hunt's-up to the day,
I aim'd so near, when I supposed you loved.
I am a-weary, give me leave awhile:
I am content, so thou wilt have it so.
I am for you.
I am hurt.
I am no pilot; yet, wert thou as far
I am not I, if there be such an I;
I am the drudge and toil in your delight,
I am the greatest, able to do least,
I am the youngest of that name, for fault of a worse.
I am too bold, 'tis not to me she speaks:
I am too sore enpierced with his shaft
I am too young; I pray you, pardon me.'
I bade her come. What, lamb! what, ladybird!
I bear no hatred, blessed man, for, lo,
I beg for justice, which thou, prince, must give;
I bring thee tidings of the prince's doom.
I brought my master news of Juliet's death;
I came to talk of. Tell me, daughter Juliet,
I can tell you; but young Romeo will be older when
I cannot bound a pitch above dull woe:
I cannot sum up sum of half my wealth.
I charge thee in the princes name, obey.
I come from Lady Juliet.
I come, anon.--But if thou mean'st not well,
I conjure only but to raise up him.
I conjure thee by Rosaline's bright eyes,
I could not send it,--here it is again,--
I dare no longer stay.
I dare not, sir
I departed not and left him there.
I do beseech thee--
I do beseech you, sir, have patience:
I do bite my thumb, sir.
I do but keep the peace: put up thy sword,
I do defy thy conjurations,
I do protest, I never injured thee,
I do remember an apothecary,--
I do remember well where I should be,
I doubt it not; and all these woes shall serve
I dream'd a dream to-night.
I dreamt my lady came and found me dead--
I dreamt my master and another fought,
I drew to part them: in the instant came
I fear it is: and yet, methinks, it should not,
I fear, too early: for my mind misgives
I gave thee mine before thou didst request it:
I have a faint cold fear thrills through my veins,
I have a head, sir, that will find out logs,
I have an interest in your hate's proceeding,
I have been feasting with mine enemy,
I have forgot that name, and that name's woe.
I have forgot why I did call thee back.
I have more care to stay than will to go:
I have my wish.
I have night's cloak to hide me from their sight;
I have no joy of this contract to-night:
I have remember'd me, thou's hear our counsel.
I have.
I hear some noise within; dear love, adieu!
I hear some noise. Lady, come from that nest
I hear thou must, and nothing may prorogue it,
I know not how to tell thee who I am:
I know not, sir.
I know not.
I married them; and their stol'n marriage-day
I mean, an we be in choler, we'll draw.
I mean, sir, in delay
I met the youthful lord at Laurence' cell;
I must be gone and live, or stay and die.
I must hear from thee every day in the hour,
I must indeed; and therefore came I hither.
I must needs wake her. Madam, madam, madam!
I must needs wake you; Lady! lady! lady!
I must up-fill this osier cage of ours
I neither know it nor can learn of him.
I never should forget it: 'Wilt thou not, Jule?' quoth he;
I nursed her daughter, that you talk'd withal;
I pay thy poverty, and not thy will.
I pray thee, chide not; she whom I love now
I pray thee, good Mercutio, let's retire:
I pray thee, leave me to my self to-night,
I pray you, tell my lord and father, madam,
I promise you, but for your company,
I saw her laid low in her kindred's vault,
I saw no man use you a pleasure; if I had, my weapon
I saw the wound, I saw it with mine eyes,--
I say 'silver sound,' because musicians sound for silver.
I sell thee poison; thou hast sold me none.
I shall forget, to have thee still stand there,
I should have been more strange, I must confess,
I speak no treason.
I stretch it out for that word 'broad;' which added
I strike quickly, being moved.
I take it, is a gentlemanlike offer.
I take thee at thy word:
I tell thee what: get thee to church o' Thursday,
I tell you, he that can lay hold of her
I thank you, honest gentlemen; good night.
I think it best you married with the county.
I think you are happy in this second match,
I thought all for the best.
I thought thy disposition better temper'd.
I wake before the time that Romeo
I warrant thee, my man's as true as steel.
I warrant, an I should live a thousand years,
I was your mother much upon these years
I will be brief, for my short date of breath
I will be deaf to pleading and excuses;
I will be gone, sir, and not trouble you.
I will bite thee by the ear for that jest.
I will confess to you that I love him.
I will follow you.
I will frown as I pass by, and let them take it as
I will give you the minstrel.
I will not budge for no man's pleasure, I.
I will not fail: 'tis twenty years till then.
I will not marry yet; and, when I do, I swear,
I will omit no opportunity
I will tell her, sir, that you do protest; which, as
I will then give it you soundly.
I will withdraw: but this intrusion shall
I will, and know her mind early to-morrow;
I wonder at this haste; that I must wed
I would adventure for such merchandise.
I would have been a-bed an hour ago.
I would I were thy bird.
I would not for the wealth of all the town
I would not for the world they saw thee here.
I would say thou hadst suck'd wisdom from thy teat.
I would the fool were married to her grave!
I would thou hadst my bones, and I thy news:
I would thou wert so happy by thy stay,
I' faith, I am sorry that thou art not well.
I'll be a candle-holder, and look on.
I'll bury thee in a triumphant grave;
I'll call them back again to comfort me:
I'll fa you; do you note me?
I'll frown and be perverse an say thee nay,
I'll give thee armour to keep off that word:
I'll go along, no such sight to be shown,
I'll go and chat with Paris: hie, make haste,
I'll have this knot knit up to-morrow morning.
I'll know his grievance, or be much denied.
I'll lay fourteen of my teeth,--
I'll look to like, if looking liking move:
I'll make you quiet. What, cheerly, my hearts!
I'll not endure him.
I'll not to bed to-night; let me alone;
I'll pay that doctrine, or else die in debt.
I'll play the housewife for this once. What, ho!
I'll say yon grey is not the morning's eye,
I'll tell thee as we pass; but this I pray,
I'll tell thee, ere thou ask it me again.
I'll to him; he is hid at Laurence' cell.
I'll to my rest.
I'll to the friar, to know his remedy:
I, measuring his affections by my own,
If all else fail, myself have power to die.
If any of my kinsmen find thee here.
If e'er thou wast thyself and these woes thine,
If ever you disturb our streets again,
If good, thou shamest the music of sweet news
If he be slain, say 'I'; or if not, no:
If I did stay to look on his intents.
If I do so, it will be of more price,
If I may trust the flattering truth of sleep,
If love be blind, love cannot hit the mark.
If love be rough with you, be rough with love;
If my heart's dear love--
If no inconstant toy, nor womanish fear,
If that thy bent of love be honourable,
If they do see thee, they will murder thee.
If thou art dun, we'll draw thee from the mire
If thou art fickle, what dost thou with him.
If thou art taken: hence, be gone, away!
If thou be merciful,
If thou dost love, pronounce it faithfully:
If what thou speak'st speak not of remedy.
if you be he, sir, I desire some confidence with
If you do, sir, I am for you: I serve as good a man as you.
If, in thy wisdom, thou canst give no help,
If, rather than to marry County Paris,
Immediately we do exile him hence:
Immoderately she weeps for Tybalt's death,
In all her best array bear her to church:
In all respects by me; nay, more, I doubt it not.
In bed asleep, while they do dream things true.
In carrion-flies than Romeo: they my seize
In dear employment: therefore hence, be gone:
In fair Verona, where we lay our scene,
In faith, I will. Let me peruse this face.
In half an hour she promised to return.
In herbs, plants, stones, and their true qualities:
In lasting labour of his pilgrimage!
In love?
In man as well as herbs, grace and rude will;
In moral paradise of such sweet flesh?
In my behalf; my reputation stain'd
In one respect I'll thy assistant be;
In penalty alike; and 'tis not hard, I think,
In sadness, cousin, I do love a woman.
In shape no bigger than an agate-stone
In such a gorgeous palace!
In tatter'd weeds, with overwhelming brows,
In that dim monument where Tybalt lies.
In that word's death; no words can that woe sound.
In the mean time, against thou shalt awake,
In thee at once; which thou at once wouldst lose.
In these confusions. Heaven and yourself
In this resolve: I'll send a friar with speed
In this so sudden business.
In thy best robes uncover'd on the bier
In truth, fair Montague, I am too fond,
In what I further shall intend to do,
In what vile part of this anatomy
inch narrow to an ell broad!
Indeed, I never shall be satisfied
Indeed, I should have ask'd you that before.

Is fair and honest, and in his mistres s' name
Is father, mother, Tybalt, Romeo, Juliet,
Is guilty of this lamentable chance!
Is he gone, and hath nothing?
Is it e'en so? why, then, I thank you all
Is it even so? then I defy you, stars!
Is it good den?
Is it more sin to wish me thus forsworn,
Is loathsome in his own deliciousness
Is longer than the tale thou dost excuse.
Is love a tender thing? it is too rough,
Is my dear son with such sour company:
Is my poor heart for a kinsman vex'd.

Is Romeo slaughter'd, and is Tybalt dead?
Is Rosaline, whom thou didst love so dear,

Is she a Capulet?
Is she not down so late, or up so early?
Is she not proud? doth she not count her blest,
Is the day so young?
Is there no pity sitting in the clouds,
Is this the poultice for my aching bones?

It cannot countervail the exchange of joy
It did, it did; alas the day, it did!
It doth so, holy sir; and there's my master,
It fits, when such a villain is a guest:
It helps not, it prevails not: talk no more.
It is an honour that I dream not of.
It is enough I may but call her mine.
It is my lady, O, it is my love!
It is my soul that calls upon my name:
It is my will, the which if thou respect,
It is some meteor that the sun exhales,
It is supposed, the fair creature died;
It is the east, and Juliet is the sun.
It is the lark that sings so out of tune,
It is too rash, too unadvised, too sudden;
It is, it is: hie hence, be gone, away!
It may be so, for it is not mine own.
It may be thought we held him carelessly,

It rains downright.
It seems she hangs upon the cheek of night
It shall be Romeo, whom you know I hate,
It strains me past the compass of my wits:

It was the nightingale, and not the lark,
It was. What sadness lengthens Romeo's hours?
It were a grief, so brief to part with thee: Farewell.

More honourable state, more courtship lives
More light and light; more dark and dark our woes!
More light, you knaves; and turn the tables up,
More than prince of cats, I can tell you. O, he is
More torches here! Come on then, let's to bed.
Most detestable death, by thee beguil'd,
Most lamentable day, most woful day,
Most miserable hour that e'er time saw

Move them no more by crossing their high will.
Much more than death: do not say 'banishment.'

Must climb a bird's nest soon when it is dark:

My blood for your rude brawls doth lie a-bleeding;
My bosom's lord sits lightly in his throne;
My bounty is as boundless as the sea,
My child is yet a stranger in the world;
My conceal'd lady to our cancell'd love?
My daughter he hath wedded: I will die,
My dear-loved cousin, and my dearer lord?
My dear?
My dismal scene I needs must act alone.
My dreams presage some joyful news at hand:
My ears have not yet drunk a hundred words

My father Capulet will have it so;
My fingers itch. Wife, we scarce thought us blest
My grave is like to be my wedding bed.
My house and welcome on their pleasure stay.
My husband is on earth, my faith in heaven;
My husband lives, that Tybalt would have slain;
My intercession likewise steads my foe.
My leisure serves me, pensive daughter, now.

My lips, two blushing pilgrims, ready stand
My lord and you were then at Mantua:--
My lord, I would that Thursday were to-morrow.
My lord, I'll tell my lady you will come.
My lord, we must entreat the time alone.

My naked weapon is out: quarrel, I will back thee.
My name, dear saint, is hateful to myself,
My noble uncle, do you know the cause?
My only love sprung from my only hate!
My poverty, but not my will, consents.
My sword, I say! Old Montague is come,
My true love's passion: therefore pardon me,
My very friend, hath got his mortal hurt
My will to her consent is but a part;
My words would bandy her to my sweet love,
Myself condemned and myself excused.
Nay, an there were two such, we should have none
Nay, as they dare. I will bite my thumb at them;
Nay, come, I pray thee, speak; good, good nurse, speak.
Nay, gentle Romeo, we must have you dance.

No money, on my faith, but the gleek;

O brother Montague, give me thy hand:
O calm, dishonourable, vile submission!

O churl! drunk all, and left no friendly drop
O comfortable friar! where is my lord?
O courteous Tybalt! honest gentleman!
O cousin, cousin!
O day! O day! O day! O hateful day!
O deadly sin! O rude unthankfulness!
O dear account! my life is my foe's debt.
O fortune, fortune! all men call thee fickle:
O friar, the damned use that word in hell;
O God! did Romeo's hand shed Tybalt's blood?
O God!--O nurse, how shall this be prevented?
O God's lady dear!
O God, I have an ill-divining soul!
O God, she comes!

O love! O life! not life, but love in death!
O me! this sight of death is as a bell,
O me, O me! My child, my only life,
O my dear kinsman! Prince, as thou art true,
O nature, what hadst thou to do in hell,
O noble prince, I can discover all

O'er courtiers' knees, that dream on court'sies straight,
O'er ladies ' lips, who straight on kisses dream,
O'er lawyers' fingers, who straight dream on fees,

O, bid me leap, rather than marry Paris,
O, break, my heart! poor bankrupt, break at once!
O, by this count I shall be much in years
O, find him! give this ring to my true knight,
O, God ye god-den.

O, I am fortune's fool!
O, I am slain!
O, I cry you mercy; you are the singer: I will say

O, speak again, bright angel! for thou art
O, swear not by the moon, the inconstant moon,
O, sweet my mother, cast me not away!
O, teach me how I should forget to think.
O, that I were a glove upon that hand,
O, that she knew she were!
O, then I see that madmen have no ears.
O, then, dear saint, let lips do what hands do;
O, then, I see Queen Mab hath been with you.
O, this same thought did but forerun my need;
O, thou art deceived; I would have made it short:
O, thou wilt speak again of banishment.
O, well-a-day, that ever I was born!
O, what a beast was I to chide at him!
O, what more favour can I do to thee,
O, where is Romeo? saw you him to-day?
O, wilt thou leave me so unsatisfied?
Obey, and go with me; for thou must die.
Of a despised life closed in my breast
Of a poor 'pothecary, and therewithal
Of all my buried ancestors are packed:
Of all the days of the year, upon that day:
Of an old tear that is not wash'd off yet:
Of breaches, ambuscadoes, Spanish blades,
Of dear import, and the neglecting it
Of death, contagion, and unnatural sleep:
Of disobedient opposition
Of fair demesnes, youthful, and nobly train'd,
Of healths five-fathom deep; and then anon
Of her awaking, here untimely lay
Of honourable reckoning are you both;
Of ill-shaped fishes; and about his shelves
Of limping winter treads, even such delight
Of love?
of Montagues, I pray, come and crush a cup of wine.
Of mortals that fall back to gaze on him
Of my child's love: I think she will be ruled
Of my dug and felt it bitter, pretty fool,
Of one I danced withal.
Of some strange nature, letting it there stand
Of stout Mercutio, and then Tybalt fled;
Of that tongue's utterance, yet I know the sound:
Of this day's journey, and from nine till twelve
Of this sir-reverence love, wherein thou stick'st
Of twenty men, it would dispatch you straight.
Of Tybalt deaf to peace, but that he tilts
Of yonder knight?
On Lammas-eve at night shall she be fourteen;
On pain of torture, from those bloody hands
On the fair daughter of rich Capulet:
On the fore-finger of an alderman,
On the white wonder of dear Juliet's hand
On this fair corse; and, as the custom is,
On Thursday next be married to this county.
On Thursday, sir? the time is very short.
Once more, on pain of death, all men depart.
One calls within 'Juliet.'
One desperate grief cures with another's languish:
One fairer than my love! the all-seeing sun
One more, most welcome, makes my number more.
One nick-name for her purblind son and heir,
One of our order, to associate me,
One pain is lessen'd by another's anguish;
One that you love.
One who, to put thee from thy heaviness,
One writ with me in sour misfortune's book!
One, gentlewoman, that God hath made for himself to
Open the tomb, lay me with Juliet.
Opens the tomb
or a hair less, in his beard, than thou hast: thou
Or am I mad, hearing him talk of Juliet,
Or bid me go into a new-made grave
Or by the break of day disguised from hence:
Or dedicate his beauty to the sun.
Or else beshrew them both.
Or else depart; here all eyes gaze on us.
Or I shall faint. A plague o' both your houses!
Or I will drag thee on a hurdle thither.
Or if not so, then here I hit it right,
Or if thou think'st I am too quickly won,
Or ill-beseeming beast in seeming both!
Or in my cell there would she kill herself.
Or manage it to part these men with me.
Or my true heart with treacherous revolt
Or never after look me in the face:
Or shall I come to you at evening mass?
Or shall we on without a apology?
Or shut me nightly in a charnel-house,
Or those eyes shut, that make thee answer 'I.'
Or to dispraise my lord with that same tongue
Or walk in thievish ways; or bid me lurk
Or, if he do, it needs must be by stealth.
Or, if his mind be writ, give me his letter.
Or, if I live, is it not very like,
Or, if sour woe delights in fellowship
Or, if thou wilt not, be but sworn my love,
Or, if thou wilt, swear by thy gracious self,
Or, if you do not, make the bridal bed
Or, wanting that, with tears distill'd by moans:
other reason but because thou hast hazel eyes: what
Our bridal flowers serve for a buried corse,
Our instruments to melancholy bells,
Our Romeo hath not been in bed to-night.
Our solemn hymns to sullen dirges change,
Our wedding cheer to a sad burial feast,
Our whole city is much bound to him.
Out of her favour, where I am in love.
Out on her, hilding!
Out upon you! what a man are you!
Out, you green-sickness carrion! out, you baggage!

Romeo can,
Romeo is banish'd; and all the world to nothing,
'Romeo is banished,' to speak that word,
Romeo is coming.
Romeo shall thank thee, daughter, for us both.
Romeo slew him, he slew Mercutio;
Romeo slew Tybalt, Romeo must not live.
Romeo that kill'd him, he is banished.
Romeo that spoke him fair, bade him bethink
Romeo will answer it.
Romeo!
Romeo!
Romeo! humours! madman! passion! lover!
Romeo! my cousin Romeo!
Romeo! O, pale! Who else? what, Paris too?
Romeo's a dishclout to him: an eagle, madam,
Romeo, away, be gone!
Romeo, bon jour! there's a French salutation
Romeo, come forth; come forth, thou fearful man:
Romeo, good night: I'll to my truckle-bed;
Romeo, I come! this do I drink to thee.
Romeo, that she were, O, that she were
Romeo, the hate I bear thee can afford
Romeo, there dead, was husband to that Juliet;
Romeo, will you come to your father's? we'll
Romeo.
Rosaline; Livia; Signior Valentio and his cousin
rosemary and Romeo begin both with a letter?
Run to my study. By and by! God's will,
Said he not so? or did I dream it so?
Sailing in this salt flood; the winds, thy sighs;
Saint Francis be my speed! how oft to-night
Saints do not move, though grant for prayers' sake.

She falls upon her bed, within the curtains
She hath forsworn to love, and in that vow
She hath not seen the change of fourteen years,
She hath, and in that sparing makes huge waste,
She is not fourteen. How long is it now
She is the fairies' midwife, and she comes
She is the hopeful lady of my earth:
She is too fair, too wise, wisely too fair,
She shall be married to this noble earl.
She speaks yet she says nothing: what of that?
She speaks:
She wakes; and I entreated her come forth,
She was too good for me: but, as I said,
She will beshrew me much that Romeo
She will indite him to some supper.
She will not stay the siege of loving terms,
She would be as swift in motion as a ball;
She's dead, deceased, she's dead; alack the day!
She's not fourteen.

Should, without eyes, see pathways to his will!

Snatching ROMEO's dagger
So early waking, what with loathsome smells,
So early walking did I see your son:
So fairly bound? O that deceit should dwell
So far from sounding and discovery,
So fearful were they of infection.
So loving-jealous of his liberty.
So many guests invite as here are writ.
So many thousand times? Go, counsellor;
So please you, let me now be left alone,
So Romeo would, were he not Romeo call'd,
So shall no foot upon the churchyard tread,
So shall you feel the loss, but not the friend
So shall you share all that he doth possess,
So shalt thou show me friendship. Take thou that:
So shows a snowy dove trooping with crows,
So smile the heavens upon this holy act,
So soon forsaken? young men's love then lies
So soon to bid good morrow to thy bed:
So stakes me to the ground I cannot move.
So stumblest on my counsel?
So that my speed to Mantua there was stay'd.
So thou wilt woo; but else, not for the world.
So thrive my soul--
So will ye, I am sure, that you love me.
So worthy a gentleman to be her bridegroom?

Soft! take me with you, take me with you, wife.

Some consequence yet hanging in the stars
Some five and twenty years; and then we mask'd.
Some Juliet, and some Paris; and all run,
Some means to come to shrift this afternoon;
Some misadventure.
Some say the lark and loathed toad change eyes,
Some say the lark makes sweet division;
Some shall be pardon'd, and some punished:
Some twenty of them fought in this black strife,
Some word there was, worser than Tybalt's death,

Sometime she gallops o'er a courtier's nose,

Sovereign, here lies the County Paris slain;
Spakest thou of Juliet? how is it with her?
Spare not for the cost.
Speak briefly, can you like of Paris' love?
Speak but one rhyme, and I am satisfied;
Speak not, reply not, do not answer me;
Speak to my gossip Venus one fair word,
Speak, nephew, were you by when it began?
Speakest thou from thy heart?
Spread thy close curtain, love-performing night,
Stabs herself
Stand not amazed: the prince will doom thee death,
Stand up, stand up; stand, and you be a man:
Stands tiptoe on the misty mountain tops.
Stay but a little, I will come again.
Stay not to question, for the watch is coming;
Stay not, be gone; live, and hereafter say,
Stay, fellow; I can read.
Stay, then; I'll go alone. Fear comes upon me:
Staying for thine to keep him company:
Still blush, as thinking their own kisses sin;
Still-waking sleep, that is not what it is!
Stop there, stop there.
Stop thy unhallow'd toil, vile Montague!
Straining harsh discords and unpleasing sharps.
Strange dream, that gives a dead man leave
Strike, drum.
Stuff'd, as they say, with honourable parts,
Subtly hath minister'd to have me dead,
such a case as mine a man may strain courtesy.
Such as I love; and you, among the store,
Such as would please: 'tis gone, 'tis gone, 'tis gone:
Such comfort as do lusty young men feel
Such mortal drugs I have; but Mantua's law
Supper is done, and we shall come too late.
Sups the fair Rosaline whom thou so lovest,
Susan and she--God rest all Christian souls!--
Suspecting that we both were in a house
Sweet flower, with flowers thy bridal bed I strew,--
sweet sorrow,
Sweet, so would I:
Sweet, sweet, sweet nurse, tell me, what says my love?
Switch and spurs, switch and spurs; or I'll cry a match.
Take all myself.
Take heed, take heed, for such die miserable.
Take him and cut him out in little stars,
take it in what sense thou wilt.
Take our good meaning, for our judgment sits
take the wall of any man or maid of Montague's.
Take thou some new infection to thy eye,
Take thou this vial, being then in bed,
Take up those cords: poor ropes, you are beguiled,
Taking the measure of an unmade grave.
Taking thy part, hath rush'd aside the law,
Talk not to me, for I'll not speak a word:
Tell me in sadness, who is that you love.
Tell me not, friar, that thou hear'st of this,
Tempering extremities with extreme sweet.
Than death prorogued, wanting of thy love.
Than empty tigers or the roaring sea.
Than the death-darting eye of cockatrice:
Than these poor compounds that thou mayst not sell.
Than this of Juliet and her Romeo.
Than those that have more cunning to be strange.
Than thou went'st forth in lamentation.
Than twenty of their swords: look thou but sweet,
Than with that hand that cut thy youth in twain
Than your consent gives strength to make it fly.
Thank me no thankings, nor, proud me no prouds,
That 'banished,' that one word 'banished,'
That after hours with sorrow chide us not!
That all the world will be in love with night
That almost freezes up the heat of life:
That birds would sing and think it were not night.
That book in many's eyes doth share the glory,
That calls our person from our morning's rest?
That copest with death himself to scape from it:
That dreamers often lie.
That ever I should live to see thee dead!
That ever, ever, I did yet behold!
That fair for which love groan'd for and would die,
That gallant spirit hath aspired the clouds,
That God had lent us but this only child;
That he dares ne'er come back to challenge you;
That he shall soon keep Tybalt company:
That he should hither come as this dire night,
That heaven finds means to kill your joys with love.
That I have worn a visor and could tell
That I might touch that cheek!
That I must love a loathed enemy.
That I revived, and was an emperor.
That I shall say good night till it be morrow.
That I will show you shining at this feast,
That I yet know not?
That idles in the wanton summer air,
That in gold clasps locks in the golden story;
That in thy likeness thou appear to us!
That is no slander, sir, which is a truth;
That is renown'd for faith? Be fickle, fortune;
that is something stale and hoar ere it be spent.
That is, because the traitor murderer lives.
That last is true; the sweeter rest was mine.
That late thou gavest me; for Mercutio's soul
That living mortals, hearing them, run mad:--
That may be must be, love, on Thursday next.
That may be, sir, when I may be a wife.
That may convey my greetings, love, to thee.
That monthly changes in her circled orb,
That most are busied when they're most alone,
That murder'd me: I would forget it fain;
That murder'd my love's cousin, with which grief,
That one short minute gives me in her sight:
that Petrarch flowed in: Laura to his lady was but a
That pierced the fearful hollow of thine ear;
That plats the manes of horses in the night,
That presses them and learns them first to bear,
That quench the fire of your pernicious rage
That Romeo bid thee fetch?
That Romeo should, upon receipt thereof,
That runaway's eyes may wink and Romeo
that runs lolling up and down to hide his bauble in a hole.
That same villain, Romeo.
That sees into the bottom of my grief?
That shall she, marry; I remember it well.
That she doth give her sorrow so much sway,
That shows thee a weak slave; for the weakest goes
That slew thy kinsman, brave Mercutio.
That the life-weary taker may fall dead
that they cannot at ease on the old bench? O, their
That thou consent to marry us to-day.
That thou expect'st not nor I look'd not for.
That thou hast done me; therefore turn and draw.
That thou her maid art far more fair than she:
That tips with silver all these fruit-tree tops--
That unsubstantial death is amorous,
That villain cousin would have kill'd my husband:
That warns my old age to a sepulchre.
That we have had no time to move our daughter:
That we may call it early by and by.
That were some spite: my invocation
That westward rooteth from the city's side,
That when she dies with beauty dies her store.
That while Verona by that name is known,
That you are now a maid. Thus then in brief:
That you run mad, seeing that she is well:
That you shall all repent the loss of mine:
That you shall rest but little. God forgive me,
That's a certain text.
That's as much as to say, such a case as yours
That's by me wounded: both our remedies
That's my good son: but where hast thou been, then?
The ape is dead, and I must conjure him.
The boy gives warning something doth approach.
The brightness of her cheek would shame those stars,
The citizens are up, and Tybalt slain.
The clock struck nine when I did send the nurse;
The collars of the moonshine's watery beams,
The County Paris hath set up his rest,
The County Paris, at Saint Peter's Church,
The county will be here with music straight,
the courageous captain of compliments. He fights as
The cover of the wings of grasshoppers,
The curfew-bell hath rung, 'tis three o'clock:
The dashing rocks thy sea-sick weary bark!
The date is out of such prolixity:
The day is broke; be wary, look about.
The day is hot, the Capulets abroad,
The day to cheer and night's dank dew to dry,
The doors of breath, seal with a righteous kiss
The earth hath swallow'd all my hopes but she,
The earth that's nature's mother is her tomb;
The exchange of thy love's faithful vow for mine.
The excuse that thou dost make in this delay
The fearful passage of their death-mark'd love,
The fee-simple! O simple!
The fiery Tybalt, with his sword prepared,
The fish lives in the sea, and 'tis much pride
The form of death: meantime I writ to Romeo,
The gallant, young and noble gentleman,
The game was ne'er so fair, and I am done.
The grey-eyed morn smiles on the frowning night,
The ground is bloody; search about the churchyard:
The hateful mansion.
The heads of the maids?
The heavens do lour upon you for some ill;
The horrible conceit of death and night,
The lady stirs.
The law that threaten'd death becomes thy friend
The letter was not nice but full of charge
The life of Tybalt.
The measure done, I'll watch her place of stand,
The more I have, for both are infinite.
The most you sought was her promotion;
The noble Paris and true Romeo dead.
The obsequies that I for thee will keep
The only son of your great enemy.
The orchard walls are high and hard to climb,
The other did not so.
The Page whistles
the pantry, and every thing in extremity. I must
The people in the street cry Romeo,
the porter let in Susan Grindstone and Nell.
The pox of such antic, lisping, affecting
The precious treasure of his eyesight lost:
The pretty wretch left crying and said 'Ay.'
The quarrel is between our masters and us their men.
The roses in thy lips and cheeks shall fade
The shady curtains from Aurora's bed,
The ship, sir, the slip; can you not conceive?
The son and heir of old Tiberio.
The stony entrance of this sepulchre?
the streets,
The sun not yet thy sighs from heaven clears,
The sun, for sorrow, will not show his head:
The tears have got small victory by that;
the third in your bosom: the very butcher of a silk
The time and my intents are savage-wild,
The traces of the smallest spider's web,
The unlucky manage of this fatal brawl:
The unreasonable fury of a beast:
The valiant Paris seeks you for his love.
The vaulty heaven so high above our heads:
The what?
The which if you with patient ears attend,
The world affords no law to make thee rich;
The world is not thy friend nor the world's law;
the--No; I know it begins with some other
Thee here in dark to be his paramour?
thee!' and by the operation of the second cup draws
their books,
Their course of love, the tidings of her death:
Then be not poor, but break it, and take this.
Then dreams, he of another benefice:
Then gave I her, so tutor'd by my art,
Then have at you with my wit! I will dry-beat you
Then have my lips the sin that they have took.
Then hie you hence to Friar Laurence' cell;
Then I will give you the serving-creature.
Then is it likely thou wilt undertake
Then love-devouring death do what he dare;
Then mightst thou speak, then mightst thou tear thy hair,
Then move not, while my prayer's effect I take.
'Then music with her silver sound
Then music with her silver sound'--
Then plainly know my heart's dear love is set
Then say at once what thou dost know in this.
Then say, Jove laughs. O gentle Romeo,
Then she hath sworn that she will still live chaste?
Then she is well, and nothing can be ill:
Then weep no more. I'll send to one in Mantua,
Then will I lay the serving-creature's dagger on
Then, as the manner of our country is,
Then, dreadful trumpet, sound the general doom!
Then, since the case so stands as now it doth,
Then, window, let day in, and let life out.
There art thou happy: Tybalt would kill thee,
There is no end, no limit, measure, bound,
There is no world without Verona walls,
There is thy gold, worse poison to men's souls,
There lies that Tybalt.
There lies the man, slain by young Romeo,
There on the ground, with his own tears made drunk.
there rust, and let me die.
There shall no figure at such rate be set
There stays a husband to make you a wife:
There's no trust,
Therefore be patient, take no note of him:
Therefore do nimble-pinion'd doves draw love,
Therefore farewell; I see thou know'st me not.
Therefore love moderately; long love doth so;
Therefore stay yet; thou need'st not to be gone.
Therefore thy earliness doth me assure
Therefore thy kinsmen are no let to me.
Therefore use none: let Romeo hence in haste,
Therefore we'll have some half a dozen friends,
Therefore, have done: some grief shows much of love;
therefore, if thou art moved, thou runn'st away.
Therefore, out of thy long-experienced time,
These dead men's tombs.
These griefs, these woes, these sorrows make me old.
These happy masks that kiss fair ladies' brows
these strange flies, these fashion-mongers, these
These times of woe afford no time to woo.
These violent delights have violent ends
They are all forth. Well, I will walk myself
They are but beggars that can count their worth;
They are free men, but I am banished.
They call for dates and quinces in the pastry.
They fight
They fight
They fight
They fight
They fight; TYBALT falls
They have made worms' meat of me: I have it,
they list.
They must take it in sense that feel it.
They pray, grant thou, lest faith turn to despair.
They'll be in scarlet straight at any news.
Things for the cook, sir; but I know not what.
Things have fall'n out, sir, so unluckily,
Things that, to hear them told, have made me tremble;
Think true love acted simple modesty.

This afternoon, sir? well, she shall be there.
This bud of love, by summer's ripening breath,
This but begins the woe, others must end.
This cannot anger him: 'twould anger him
This dagger hath mista'en--for, lo, his house
This day's black fate on more days doth depend;
This doth not so, for she divideth us:
This field-bed is too cold for me to sleep:
This gentleman, the prince's near ally,
This holy shrine, the gentle fine is this:
This is as't should be. Let me see the county;
This is dear mercy, and thou seest it not.
This is my daughter's jointure, for no more
This is not Romeo, he's some other where.
This is she--
This is that banish'd haughty Montague,
This is the hag, when maids lie on their backs,
This is the matter:--Nurse, give leave awhile,
This is the place; there, where the torch doth burn.
This is the truth, or let Benvolio die.
This is thy sheath;
This letter doth make good the friar's words,
This letter he early bid me give his father,
This love feel I, that feel no love in this.
This neighbour air, and let rich music's tongue
This night I hold an old accustom'd feast,
This night you shall behold him at our feast;
This precious book of love, this unbound lover,
This same should be the voice of Friar John.
This shall determine that.
This torture should be roar'd in dismal hell.
This trick may chance to scathe you, I know what:
This vault a feasting presence full of light.
This wind, you talk of, blows us from ourselves;
This, by his voice, should be a Montague.
Thou and my bosom henceforth shall be twain.
Thou and these woes were all for Rosaline:
Thou art like one of those fellows that when he
Thou art not conquer'd; beauty's ensign yet
Thou art thyself, though not a Montague.
Thou art up-roused by some distemperature;
Thou canst not speak of that thou dost not feel:
Thou chid'st me oft for loving Rosaline.
Thou counterfeit'st a bark, a sea, a wind;
Thou cutt'st my head off with a golden axe,
Thou desirest me to stop in my tale against the hair.
Thou desperate pilot, now at once run on
Thou detestable maw, thou womb of death,
Thou fond mad man, hear me but speak a word.
Thou hast amazed me: by my holy order,
Thou hast most kindly hit it.
Thou hast the strength of will to slay thyself,
Thou know'st my daughter's of a pretty age.
Thou know'st my lodging: get me ink and paper,
Thou know'st the mask of night is on my face,
thou make minstrels of us, look to hear nothing but
Thou mayst prove false; at lovers' perjuries
Thou pout'st upon thy fortune and thy love:
Thou shalt be borne to that same ancient vault
Thou shalt be logger-head. Good faith, 'tis day:
Thou shalt continue two and forty hours,
Thou shalt not stir a foot to seek a foe.
Thou sober-suited matron, all in black,
Thou talk'st of nothing.
Thou villain Capulet,--Hold me not, let me go.
Thou wast never with me for any thing when thou wast
Thou wast the prettiest babe that e'er I nursed:
thou what thou art, by art as well as by nature:
Thou wilt be taken. Stay awhile! Stand up;
Thou wilt fall backward when thou comest to age;
Thou wilt fall backward when thou hast more wit;
thou wilt quarrel with a man that hath a hair more,
Thou wouldst else have made thy tale large.
Thou wrong'st it, more than tears, with that report.
Thou, wretched boy, that didst consort him here,
Though heaven cannot: O Romeo, Romeo!
Though news be sad, yet tell them merrily;
though they be not to be talked on, yet they are
Three civil brawls, bred of an airy word,
Three words, dear Romeo, and good night indeed.
Through fair Verona; find those persons out
Through lovers' brains, and then they dream of love;
Throw your mistemper'd weapons to the ground,
Throws them down
Thursday is near; lay hand on heart, advise:
Thus from my lips, by yours, my sin is purged.
Thus I enforce thy rotten jaws to open,
Thy beauty hath made me effeminate
Thy dear love sworn but hollow perjury,
Thy drugs are quick. Thus with a kiss I die.
Thy face is mine, and thou hast slander'd it.
Thy father, or thy mother, nay, or both,
Thy fault our law calls death; but the kind prince,
Thy head is as fun of quarrels as an egg is full of
Thy husband in thy bosom there lies dead;
Thy lips are warm.
Thy love did read by rote and could not spell.
Thy noble shape is but a form of wax,
Thy old groans ring yet in my ancient ears;
Thy purpose marriage, send me word to-morrow,
Thy tears are womanish; thy wild acts denote
Thy tempest-tossed body. How now, wife!
Thy wit is a very bitter sweeting; it is a most
Thy wit, that ornament to shape and love,
thy wits than, I am sure, I have in my whole five:
Tickle the senseless rushes with their heels,
Tickling a parson's nose as a' lies asleep,
Ties up my tongue, and will not let me speak.
Till holy church incorporate two in one.
Till I conveniently could send to Romeo:
Till she had laid it and conjured it down;
Till the prince came, who parted either part.
Till then, adieu; and keep this holy kiss.
Till thou shalt know the reason of my love:
Till we can clear these ambiguities,
Time out o' mind the fairies' coachmakers.
'Tis all one, I will show myself a tyrant: when I
'Tis almost morning; I would have thee gone:
'Tis but the pale reflex of Cynthia's brow;
'Tis but thy name that is my enemy;
'Tis he, that villain Romeo.
'tis known I am a pretty piece of flesh.
'Tis more, 'tis more, his son is elder, sir;
'Tis no less, I tell you, for the bawdy hand of the
'Tis now near night.
'Tis since the earthquake now eleven years;
'Tis since the nuptials of Lucentio,
'Tis the way
'Tis torture, and not mercy: heaven is here,
'Tis very late, she'll not come down to-night:
'Tis well thou art not fish; if thou hadst, thou

To be consorted with the humorous night:
To be to thee this night a torch-bearer,
To bear a poison, I would temper it;
To beautify him, only lacks a cover:
To bid me trudge:
To blaze your marriage, reconcile your friends,
To blazon it, then sweeten with thy breath
To breathe such vows as lovers use to swear;
To call hers exquisite, in question more:
To catch my death with jaunting up and down!
To cease thy suit, and leave me to my grief:

To comfort thee, though thou art banished.
To comfort you: I wot well where he is.

To mangle me with that word 'banished'?
To Mantua, with my letters to thy lord.
To marry Paris: Wednesday is to-morrow:
To meet her new-beloved any where:

To scorn at our solemnity this night.
To season love, that of it doth not taste!

When King Cophetua loved the beggar-maid!
When presently through all thy veins shall run
When the devout religion of mine eye
When the sun sets, the air doth drizzle dew;
When theirs are dry, for Romeo's banishment.
When thou didst bower the spirit of a fiend
When well-apparell'd April on the heel
Where all the kindred of the Capulets lie.
Where and what time thou wilt perform the rite;
Where are the vile beginners of this fray?
Where be these enemies? Capulet! Montague!
Where bloody Tybalt, yet but green in earth,
Where civil blood makes civil hands unclean.
Where I have learn'd me to repent the sin
Where I may read who pass'd that passing fair?
Where is my father, and my mother, nurse?
Where is my lady's lord, where's Romeo?
Where is my mother! why, she is within;
Where is my page? Go, villain, fetch a surgeon.
Where is she? and how doth she? and what says
Where is the county's page, that raised the watch?
Where is your mother?'
Where Juliet lives; and every cat and dog
Where on a sudden one hath wounded me,
Where serpents are; chain me with roaring bears;
Where shall we dine? O me! What fray was here?
Where should she be? How oddly thou repliest!
Where that same banish'd runagate doth live,
Where the devil should this Romeo be?
Where the infectious pestilence did reign,
Where thou shalt live, till we can find a time
Where's Potpan, that he helps not to take away? He
Where's Romeo's man? what can he say in this?
Where, for these many hundred years, the bones
Where, underneath the grove of sycamore
Whereto I have invited many a guest,
Which are the children of an idle brain,
Which as they kiss consume: the sweetest honey
Which craves as desperate an execution.
Which heavy sorrow makes them apt unto:
which is a disgrace to them, if they bear it.
Which is as thin of substance as the air
Which is the god of my idolatry,
Which mannerly devotion shows in this;
Which modern lamentations might have moved?
Which oft the angry Mab with blisters plagues,
Which on more view, of many mine being one
Which once untangled, much misfortune bodes:
Which she hath praised him with above compare
Which should bedeck thy shape, thy love, thy wit:
Which ten times faster glide than the sun's beams,
Which the commission of thy years and art
Which the dark night hath so discovered.
Which thou wilt propagate, to have it prest
Which to the high top-gallant of my joy
Which too untimely here did scorn the earth.
Which way ran he that kill'd Mercutio?
Which with sweet water nightly I will dew,
Which you weep for.
Which you, mistaking, offer up to joy.
Which, as he breathed defiance to my ears,
Which, but their children's end, nought could remove,
Which, like a usurer, abound'st in all,
Which, too much minded by herself alone,
Which, well thou know'st, is cross, and full of sin.
While we were interchanging thrusts and blows,
Whipp'd and tormented and--God-den, good fellow.
white wench's black eye; shot through the ear with a
Whiter than new snow on a raven's back.
Whither?
Who all as hot, turns deadly point to point,
Who bare my letter, then, to Romeo?
Who calls so loud?
Who even in pure and vestal modesty,
Who ever would have thought it? Romeo!
Who had but newly entertain'd revenge,
Who here hath lain these two days buried.
Who is already sick and pale with grief,
Who is it?
Who is't that calls? is it my lady mother?
Who knocks so hard? whence come you? what's your will?
Who lets it hop a little from her hand,
Who nothing hurt withal hiss'd him in scorn:
Who now the price of his dear blood doth owe?
Who set this ancient quarrel new abroach?
Who, raging with thy tears, and they with them,
whore!' Why, is not this a lamentable thing,
Whose house?
Whose misadventured piteous overthrows
Whose names are written there, and to them say,
Whose sale is present death in Mantua,
Why 'Heart's ease?'
why 'silver sound'? why 'music with her silver
Why art thou yet so fair? shall I believe
Why dost thou stay?
Why follow'd not, when she said 'Tybalt's dead,'
Why I descend into this bed of death,
Why rail'st thou on thy birth, the heaven, and earth?
Why should you fall into so deep an O?
Why, how now, Juliet!
Why, how now, kinsman! wherefore storm you so?
Why, I am glad on't; this is well: stand up:
Why, is not this better now than groaning for love?
Why, lamb! why, lady! fie, you slug-a-bed!
Why, love, I say! madam! sweet-heart! why, bride!
Why, may one ask?
Why, Romeo, art thou mad?
Why, such is love's transgression.
Why, then is my pump well flowered.
Why, then, O brawling love! O loving hate!
Why, uncle, 'tis a shame.
Why, what is Tybalt?
widow of Vitravio; Signior Placentio and his lovely
Wife, go you to her ere you go to bed;
will give me occasion.
Will I set up my everlasting rest,
Will ne'er wear out the everlasting flint:
Will now deny to dance? she that makes dainty,
Will they not hear? What, ho! you men, you beasts,
Will watch thy waking, and that very night
Will you be ready? do you like this haste?
Will you go to them? I will bring you thither.
Will you speak well of him that kill'd your cousin?
Will you tell me that?

Wilt thou be gone? it is not yet near day:
Wilt thou not, Jule?' and, by my holidame,
Wilt thou not, Jule?' it stinted and said 'Ay.'
Wilt thou provoke me? then have at thee, boy!
wilt tutor me from quarrelling!
Wisely and slow; they stumble that run fast.
wisely, wisely.
With all the admired beauties of Verona:
with an iron wit, and put up my iron dagger. Answer
With baleful weeds and precious-juiced flowers.
With blood removed but little from her own?
With Cupid's arrow; she hath Dian's wit;
With gentle breath, calm look, knees humbly bow'd,
with her, truly it were an ill thing to be offered
With instruments upon them, fit to open
With love's light wings did I o'er-perch these walls;
With more of thine: this love that thou hast shown
With nimble soles: I have a soul of lead
With open outcry toward our monument.
With piercing steel at bold Mercutio's breast,
With purple fountains issuing from your veins,
With reeky shanks and yellow chapless skulls;
With repetition of my Romeo's name.
With Romeo, till I behold him--dead--
With Rosaline, my ghostly father? no;
With speedy help doth lend redress.'
With tears augmenting the fresh morning dew.
With tender Juliet match'd, is now not fair.
With this night's revels and expire the term
With thy black mantle; till strange love, grown bold,
With twenty hundred thousand times more joy
With Tybalt's slander,--Tybalt, that an hour
With worms that are thy chamber-maids; O, here
Within the infant rind of this small flower
Within this hour my man shall be with thee
Within three hours will fair Juliet wake:
Within thy help and holy physic lies:
[Within] Ho, daughter! are you up?
[Within] Lead, boy: which way?
[Within] Let me come in, and you shall know
[Within] Madam!
[Within] Madam!
Without a sudden calm, will overset
Without his roe, like a dried herring: flesh, flesh,
Without that title. Romeo, doff thy name,
Women may fall, when there's no strength in men.
worn out thy pump, that when the single sole of it
Would I were sleep and peace, so sweet to rest!
Would none but I might venge my cousin's death!
Would through the airy region stream so bright
Wouldst thou withdraw it? for what purpose, love?

written, that the shoemaker should meddle with his
yard, and the tailor with his last, the fisher with
Ye say honestly: rest you merry!
Yea, is the worst well? very well took, i' faith;
Yea, noise? then I'll be brief. O happy dagger!
'Yea,' quoth he, 'dost thou fall upon thy face?
'Yea,' quoth my husband,'fall'st upon thy face?
Yes, better, sir.
Yes, madam: yet I cannot choose but laugh,
Yet 'banished'? Hang up philosophy!
Yet I should kill thee with much cherishing.
Yet let me weep for such a feeling loss.
Yet most suspected, as the time and place
Yet nature's tears are reason's merriment.
Yet put it out, for I would not be seen.
Yet tell me not, for I have heard it all.
Yon light is not day-light, I know it, I:
You are a lover; borrow Cupid's wings,
You are a saucy boy: is't so, indeed?
You are looked for and called for, asked for and
You are to blame, my lord, to rate her so.
You are too hot.
You are welcome, gentlemen! come, musicians, play.
You Capulet; shall go along with me:
you have found him than he was when you sought him:
You kiss by the book.
You lie.
You must contrary me! marry, 'tis time.
You say well.
You say you do not know the lady's mind:
You shall find me apt enough to that, sir, an you
You shall have none ill, sir; for I'll try if they
you sing prick-song, keeps time, distance, and
You tallow-face!
You will not, then?
You will set cock-a-hoop! you'll be the man!
You'll make a mutiny among my guests!
You'll not endure him! God shall mend my soul!
You, to remove that siege of grief from her,
you.
Young Adam Cupid, he that shot so trim,
Young Romeo is it?
Young son, it argues a distemper'd head
Younger than she are happy mothers made.
Your first is dead; or 'twere as good he were,
Your high displeasure: all this uttered
Your lady mother is coming to your chamber:
Your lady's love against some other maid
Your lives shall pay the forfeit of the peace.
Your looks are pale and wild, and do import
'Your love says, like an honest gentleman,
Your love says, like an honest gentleman, and a
Your mother.
Your part in her you could not keep from death,
your pate. I will carry no crotchets: I'll re you,
Your plaintain-leaf is excellent for that.
Your tributary drops belong to woe,
Your worship in that sense may call him 'man.'
